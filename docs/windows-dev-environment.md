# Native Windows development environment

- Use Windows 11 x64, Windows Terminal, PowerShell 7 and Rust MSVC natively.
  Keep a separate Windows clone; synchronize source through Git, never Linux
  `target/`, settings or compiled effects. No WSL or development VM.
- Evidence checked 2026-09-30: **V** = verified primary documentation/source;
  **R** = verified repository inspection; **O** = upstream issue report;
  **U** = unverified on this PC; **P** = recommendation, not an adopted decision.
  Source keys are at the end. Documented commands still need PC verification.
- **R:** [Windows decisions](decisions.md#windows-port) select this same PC as
  the KDE multi-output host (DP-6 and HDMI-A-2). **Settled (user 2026-09-30):**
  Windows 11 Pro x64 build 26200 dual-boots NixOS nixos-unstable; do not
  change the boot arrangement. Windows monitor IDs differ.
- **Accepted baseline (user 2026-09-30, this dev PC):** one display only.
  Historical KDE DP-6/HDMI-A-2 assertions above are unchanged; single Windows
  display vs historical KDE multi-output is not proof of a present wiring
  change (flagged contradiction, not resolved). Windows multi-monitor work
  moves to the user's other Win11 PC.

| Item | Accepted value |
| --- | --- |
| Display | ONE Gigabyte M27Q, `\\.\DISPLAY1`, `DISPLAY\GBT270D\5&35A435C3&5&UID41221`, primary, origin 0,0 |
| Mode | 2560x1440 @170Hz, 125%, calculated effective DPI 120 |
| Work area | DPI-unaware query logical 0,0-2048,1104; inferred physical 0,0-2560,1380 NOT directly queried |

- **R:** KDE-first extraction ended at K1. Start Windows Phase 1 with native
  build/tests, single-display baseline above, independent stop/restore on owned test
  windows, then physical Win+Arrow proof. Native dev/stop, exact-owner emergency
  exit and independent owned-window restore are now machine-proven on this PC;
  input proof remains pending (see the [active record](changes/windows-phase1-implementation.md)).
  This runbook grants no live-testing authority.

## Decisions needed from the user

### Before the first Windows session (on the laptop)

| Decision | Options and consequences | Recommendation (P) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root AGENTS.md dependency rule | **Decided (user 2026-09-30):** root `AGENTS.md` keeps `devenv.nix` for Linux; on Windows this document is the dependency list. New Windows tools are added here first with user approval; the user performs installs. | Done. |
| Dependency declaration file | **Decided (user 2026-09-30, extended with mise):** root `mise.toml` declares the Windows/macOS CLI and Rust tooling (OS-filtered entries; user runs installs). This runbook remains the dependency list and manual-prerequisite record. A WinGet Configuration (`.config/configuration.winget`) may follow once the setup is proven on the PC. | mise route active; WinGet config on revisit. |
| `.gitattributes` | **Decided (user 2026-09-30): repository-wide LF policy**, the contract below, added on the laptop before the Windows clone. Renormalization changed no tracked file. | Done. |
| Rust upgrades | **Settled (user 2026-09-30, option A):** pre-1.0 track latest stable Rust and fix breakage. Windows uses rustup stable default with rustfmt/clippy, no directory override and no toolchain file. Linux and existing Linux CI use the regularly bumped nixpkgs pin in `devenv.yaml`. | Revisit the upgrade process at 1.0. |
| Windows live-testing governance | **Decided (user 2026-09-30, option A):** write [live Windows testing](live-windows-testing.md) on the laptop before the first Windows session. Each experiment class still needs user authorization. | Done; follow the protocol before live work. |

### During the first Windows session

| Decision | Options and consequences | Recommendation (P) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage and long paths | **Settled (user 2026-09-30):** actual checkout `C:\Users\beefs\Development\plasma-auto-tiler`; Git longpaths per clone on; OS `LongPathsEnabled` already 1. Keep paths short without changing host registry. | Done. |
| Credentials | **Settled (user 2026-09-30):** HTTPS + GCM. | Done; do not copy credentials into the runbook. |
| CLI scope | **Settled (user 2026-09-30):** Git, rg, PS7, rustup, MSVC Build Tools 2022 + SDK, just, jq, yq, gh. No Coreutils; qsv skipped. Install route settled: root `mise.toml` manages Rust (via rustup), rg, just, jq, yq, gh; Git, MSVC Build Tools + SDK and the Store PS7 bootstrap stay manual. | Done. |
| opencode configuration and plugin version | **Settled (user 2026-09-30):** opencode via winget, known-working config transferred; PS7 Store/MSIX, not MSI, and no explicit shell path in opencode. Routing proved by first fresh muse-spark Worker; available identity model family is muse-spark with no independent provider introspection. | Smoke-test skills and `gpt-sol` -> `muse-spark` routing before work. Stop/report incompatibility rather than silently changing routing/plugins. |
| Isolation | **Settled (user 2026-09-30):** Sandbox enabled, installed and rebooted, then closed 2026-09-30 after a failed preflight (user dismissed the WM_CLOSE confirmation; no processes remain). Phase 1-3 live proof is physical-desktop owned windows first; Sandbox is deferred to Phase 4 clean runtime plus Win+L guest-only policy. Never host policy writes. | Physical first under the live protocol. Sandbox only for Phase 4 clean runtime and guest-only Win+L; if unavailable, defer those; no policy experiments on the daily desktop. |

### Line-ending contract

Adopted in root `.gitattributes` (user 2026-09-30). **V: G1:** covers Rust, TS, shell, Nix, CMake, docs, JSON/TOML and future
PowerShell files without an extension-by-extension list. PS7 accepts LF; use
UTF-8 without BOM for project text. Future CMD/batch files check out as CRLF.

```gitattributes
* text=auto eol=lf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.kwinscript binary
```

- **R:** at adoption the index held 445 LF text files and one binary
  `.kwinscript` ZIP, no CRLF text; a renormalization dry run changed no
  tracked file.
- **P:** the fresh-clone command below also stores LF settings before
  checkout (belt and braces). For an existing clone, inspect first; stop on
  conversion churn and ask the user, rather than resetting/re-checking out.

### Dependency declaration and Rust parity

- **V: W1:** `winget configure` is a supported Microsoft provisioning feature
  since WinGet 1.6.2631, not a universal package lockfile or Nix substitute.
  Microsoft's convention is `.config/configuration.winget`. Package resources
  can declare versions; referenced DSC modules also need reviewed versions.
  Resources execute code and can request admin/UAC (`securityContext:
  elevated`); start unelevated so user-scoped installs keep the user's identity.
- **V: W1:** `Microsoft.WinGet.DSC/WinGetPackage` installs packages;
  `Microsoft.VisualStudio.DSC/VSComponents` can apply workloads/components
  from `.vsconfig` (Microsoft's example permits prerelease resources).
  A package declaration for Build Tools alone does not prove C++/SDK installed.
  `winget configure show -f FILE`, `validate -f FILE`, `test -f FILE`, then
  `winget configure -f FILE` are the review/validation/application sequence.
  These files are proposals and are not present in this repository.
- **P:** WinGet installs rustup, not the chosen rustup toolchain or project
  override. `coreutils-manager disable link` is also an explicit post-install
  action. Generic DSC Script resources could do both, but add executable
  automation without a demonstrated need. WinGet import/export alone cannot
  represent these post-install states or a VS workload contract.
- **R; V: R1:** `devenv.nix` selects default nixpkgs Rust from pinned
  `devenv.yaml`; current local rustc/cargo are 1.98.1/1.98.0. No rustup or
  toolchain file is used. Direct Nix binaries ignore `rust-toolchain.toml`;
  devenv can explicitly use `languages.rust.toolchainFile` with rust-overlay.
  Existing Ubuntu CI invokes Cargo inside devenv, so a TOML file alone does
  not align CI. Rustup proxies elsewhere would honor it and might download
  a toolchain. Verify actual command paths before claiming cross-OS parity.

### Nixpkgs Rust pin bump procedure (Linux; Windows unaffected)

- **P: scope:** the `devenv.yaml` nixpkgs pin drives Linux Rust/KWin/shell
  (`devenv.nix` selects default nixpkgs Rust; Ubuntu CI invokes Cargo
  inside devenv). The `flake.nix` pin is separately reviewed scope: it
  supports native CI (`nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.native-effect-tests`)
  and standalone delivery; the KWin CI job runs script tests in devenv,
  not a native effect
  compile. `scripts/nix-host-kwin-build.sh` always resolves the exact
  installed host KWin derivation, so a devenv bump never changes host
  KWin build authority. Never edit a flake input without regenerating
  its lock.
- **P: procedure (on Linux):**
  1. Compare the candidate `nixos-unstable` revision first: its `1_xx.nix`
     `rustcVersion` must equal latest stable (confirm the default `rust =`
     selection in `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`), plus the KWin/Qt/KF
     versions (`pkgs/kde/generated/sources/{plasma,frameworks}.json`,
     `pkgs/development/libraries/qt-6/srcs.nix`).
     If latest stable is not yet on `nixos-unstable`, defer and retry a
     later revision. Overlay or `staging` routes need a separate decision.
  2. Edit the `devenv.yaml` nixpkgs `url` rev, then run
     `devenv update nixpkgs` (pinned CI CLI `github:cachix/devenv/v2.4.0`).
     Inspect the rev/hash/`devenv.lock` diff; never hand-edit hashes.
  3. Restart the Linux devenv session, then verify the selected version with
     `devenv shell --impure -- rustc -vV` before running gates.
  4. Run the Linux gates per `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (kwin, rust,
     shell, native jobs) plus the local Windows gates via the approved
     tool (`mise exec -- cargo ...`).
  5. Only when validating/activating a native build: host user runs
     `scripts/nix-host-kwin-build.sh resolve`, rebuilds the native
     effect host-matched, and activates in a fresh Plasma session.
- **P: Windows:** unchanged. `mise.toml` tracks rolling stable Rust; the
  user owns updates (`mise install`).

## Day-one setup, in order

Commands are for the **user on the PC**. This list is the Windows dependency
contract (root `AGENTS.md`); agents ask before any install. Use an ordinary
account/terminal; allow installer UAC only where required. Reopen Terminal
after installers change PATH; restart opencode after configuration changes.

### mise tool route (root `mise.toml`)

**Settled:** root `mise.toml` declares the Windows/macOS CLI and Rust
tooling with [OS-filtered entries](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/);
Linux ignores it (devenv/Nix route). The user owns installs; agents ask
before anything. After the clone (§2) and the manual prerequisites
(§§1, 4), install mise itself through its
[official winget route](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html):

```powershell
winget install --exact --id jdx.mise --source winget
```

Reopen the terminal so PATH picks up mise, then from the repo root:

```powershell
mise --version
mise trust
mise install
mise exec -- rustc -vV
mise exec -- cargo -vV
mise exec -- rg --version
```

- Managed by mise: stable Rust via rustup (mise installs rustup if absent;
  [process-local `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/rust.html),
  no persisted directory override), just, jq, yq, gh, rg. Manual
  prerequisites stay manual: Git, MSVC Build Tools 2022 + SDK, Store PS7
  bootstrap (PowerShell stays a manual host shell; it is not mise-managed).
- Run gates with `mise exec -- cargo ...` so they consume the
  mise-selected toolchain. No `rust-toolchain.toml`. Require
  `host: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.

### 1. Establish PowerShell 7 and a short checkout location

**Settled (user 2026-09-30):** PS7 Store/MSIX, not MSI; no explicit shell
path in opencode since the Store alias breaks it. **V: W2:** the Store
install uses the Store execution alias. Use the Windows Terminal PS7
profile that launches the Store PS7.

```powershell
winget --version
```

Open a fresh Terminal PS7 profile:

```powershell
$PSVersionTable
$PSHOME
where.exe pwsh
winver
```

- **P:** require edition `Core`, version >= 7.4 if Coreutils is installed;
  use current stable PS7 (Coreutils recommends >= 7.6 for `~` support).
- **V: W3:** optional Dev Drive: Windows 11 build >= 22621.2338, 8 GB RAM
  minimum/16 GB recommended, >= 50 GB free, admin setup. ReFS Dev Drive is
  Microsoft-recommended for repos/package caches, not VS/SDK/tool installs.
  Use Settings to create it only with user approval; do not repartition the
  shared KDE test PC as part of setup. Defender performance mode requires a
  trusted drive, Defender primary AV and real-time protection on (platform
  >= 4.18.2303.8, intelligence >= 1.385.1455.0). It scans asynchronously;
  it is not an exclusion. Verify `fsutil devdrv query D:` and Windows Security
  > Dev Drive protection. Keep default Cargo cache paths initially; a later
  `CARGO_HOME` relocation also requires updating the rustup shim PATH.

### 2. Install native Git and rg, then clone safely

**V: G2:** Git installer defaults: PATH option `Cmd` (Git from command line
and third-party tools), `core.autocrlf=true`, Credential Manager enabled.
Choose `Cmd`, not `CmdTools` (adds `mingw64\bin` and `usr\bin` GNU/MSYS tools).
For interactive installation choose "Checkout as-is, commit as-is"; WinGet
defaults can instead be overridden for this clone as shown. Git Bash remains
an explicit escape hatch; never the default agent shell or native build path.

```powershell
winget install --exact --id Git.Git --source winget
# rg is mise-managed (see the mise route above), not a winget install.
```

The following uses `C:\src\pat` as a fresh-clone example, not this PC's
settled checkout. Verify the selected parent exists before cloning:

```powershell
git clone --config core.autocrlf=false --config core.eol=lf --config core.longpaths=true https://github.com/beefsack/plasma-auto-tiler.git C:\src\pat
Set-Location C:\src\pat
git branch --show-current
git config --show-origin --get-regexp '^core\.(autocrlf|eol|longpaths)$'
git config --show-origin --get-all credential.helper
git check-attr text eol -- Cargo.toml kwin/src/entry.ts scripts/nix-host-kwin-build.sh devenv.nix kwin/native-effect/CMakeLists.txt docs/windows-dev-environment.md example.ps1 example.cmd
git ls-files --eol
git status --short
git diff --check
where.exe git
$env:PATH -split ';'
```

- **V: G3:** Git `core.longpaths` covers built-in Git operations, not every
  shell/tool. **V: W4:** Windows' separate `LongPathsEnabled` opt-in also
  needs app `longPathAware` support (or supported extended-path APIs); it
  does not make every Rust build script/SDK/linker/Explorer path safe.
  **U:** this PC's deep Cargo target paths have not been tested. Prefer short
  checkout/cache/output roots; no policy write is needed on day one.
  Read-only check:

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem' -Name LongPathsEnabled
```

- **P:** `example.ps1`/`example.cmd` above are deliberate attribute-pattern
  probes, not files to create. After adopting the proposal they should report
  `text: set`, with `eol: lf`/`crlf`; otherwise `unspecified` is expected.

### 3. Optional named CLI tools and Coreutils

**V: W5/W6:** only tools named by the global instructions/project are included.
just, jq, yq and gh are mise-managed (see the mise route above).
Verify with `mise exec -- <tool> --version`. qsv: choose the upstream
Windows x64 MSVC release ZIP and put `qsv.exe` in the user's approved
tools directory on PATH; no verified WinGet ID is assumed. No Node or
additional package manager is needed for the official opencode CLI
executable or the portable Rust gates.

**V: W7:** Microsoft Coreutils is a separate preview Windows package built
on uutils (first release `v2026.5.29`), including a hard-link utility named
`link`. If selected, install and disable it **before building**:

```powershell
winget install --exact --id Microsoft.Coreutils --source winget
coreutils-manager disable link
where.exe link
Get-Command ls, ls.exe, cat, cat.exe, rm, rm.exe
```

- **V: W7:** PowerShell aliases shadow utilities; use `.exe` suffixes for
  native binaries. No sed/awk; use dedicated agent tools, PS7 or jq/yq/qsv.
  The PSReadLine input wrapper is interactive, not an agent-shell guarantee.
  Coreutils does not make POSIX scripts native PowerShell scripts.

### 4. Install Build Tools and an explicitly selected Rust MSVC toolchain

**V: R2/W8:** Desktop development with C++ plus recommended MSVC x64/x86
tools and Windows SDK; full Visual Studio IDE is unnecessary. Confirm these
components in Visual Studio Installer after installation.

```powershell
winget install --exact --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --source winget --override "--wait --quiet --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended --addProductLang En-us"
```

Reopen PS7 at the checkout and follow the mise tool route above before
the Rust checks below. Pre-1.0 policy is latest stable (user
2026-09-30, option A; revisit at 1.0). Historical first-gate measurement
(2026-09-30): stable rustc/cargo 1.98.1 `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
(official stable 2026-09-03), stable default, no overrides, with
build/test/fmt --all/strict clippy pass (569 tests) and PS7 Core 7.6.6.
Historical Linux rustc/cargo 1.98.1/1.98.0 came from the `devenv.yaml`
nixpkgs pin. Policy stays latest stable; do not treat the 1.98.1 numbers
as pins.

```powershell
mise exec -- rustup show
mise exec -- rustc -vV
mise exec -- cargo -vV
mise exec -- where.exe rustc
mise exec -- where.exe cargo
```

- No persisted directory override and no `rust-toolchain.toml`. Require
  `host: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`; never GNU/MSYS for product builds.

### 5. Prove linker discovery and run native offline-development gates

**R:** source/dependency inspection, not an MSVC compilation result:

| Crate / gate | Native Windows recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| `tiler-core`, `tiler-protocol` | Build/test: pure Rust policy; zero normal core dependencies, protocol serde/serde_json. |
| `tiler-kwin-effect-ffi` | Include Rust tests/staticlib build: only portable Rust/core/serde/POD exports. Its Qt/KWin C++ consumer is Linux-only. |
| `tiler-windows` | Include build/tests/clippy; native APIs are Windows-gated, ledger tests portable. Build also produces the owned test-window binary. |
| `plasma-auto-tiler` | Exclude: unguarded `rustix::process::geteuid` plus D-Bus/KDE service/tray integration. It cannot compile as-is on MSVC; Windows needs its own adapter. |
| fmt / strict clippy | fmt all packages without compilation; clippy only the allowlist. |
| KWin npm | `npm ci` and `typecheck` can use native Node >= 24. Current build/test scripts use POSIX `rm -rf`/`VAR=value`; tests also invoke `npx` with `execFileSync` (Windows `.cmd` issue). Keep build/tests on Linux unchanged. |
| Linux gates | Workspace Rust tests/clippy, `just check-portable` (bash/jq/grep), shell suites, Nix checks, native KWin build/CTest and user live tests stay on Linux. |

- **R:** Windows target std is absent from the laptop devenv sysroot; no
  offline `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` was run or installed.
  **P:** explicit package flags are the smallest reliable boundary; changing
  `default-members` changes Linux defaults, while target-gating dependencies
  alone cannot repair unguarded Linux source.

From ordinary PS7:

```powershell
where.exe link
mise exec -- cargo build --locked -p tiler-core -p tiler-protocol -p tiler-kwin-effect-ffi -p tiler-windows
mise exec -- cargo test --locked -p tiler-core -p tiler-protocol -p tiler-kwin-effect-ffi -p tiler-windows
mise exec -- cargo fmt --all -- --check
mise exec -- cargo clippy --locked -p tiler-core -p tiler-protocol -p tiler-kwin-effect-ffi -p tiler-windows --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

- **V: R3:** rustc's MSVC discovery normally finds an absolute VS linker and
  injects SDK/LIB/PATH even outside a Developer shell. No `where.exe link`
  result in ordinary PS can coexist with a successful Rust build. In a
  Developer environment (`VCINSTALLDIR`), discovery trusts the first matching
  PATH tool: a foreign `link.exe` there can break a build despite installed VS.
  Failed discovery falls back to PATH; explicit linker overrides can bypass
  the discovered executable. `cc` build scripts discover `cl`/`lib` too;
  scripts directly invoking `link.exe` still depend on their own PATH.
- **V: W9; P:** diagnostic: open Start's **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt
  for VS 2022**, then launch the Store PS7 from that CMD window to inherit
  its environment (no hardcoded MSI path):

```cmd
pwsh.exe -NoProfile
```

```powershell
where.exe link
where.exe cl
where.exe lib
link.exe /?
$env:VCINSTALLDIR
$env:LIB
$env:INCLUDE
```

- **P:** first linker must be Microsoft's MSVC `Hostx64\x64\link.exe`.
  Do not permanently add SDK/MSVC or Git `usr\bin` to PATH; do not set an
  arbitrary Cargo linker override to hide incomplete installation.
- **R:** Windows CI job: `windows-latest`, `shell: pwsh`, checkout,
  `jdx/mise-action@v4` (runs `mise install` and exports the mise
  environment), the four commands above via `mise exec -- cargo ...`,
  a mise tool version/host smoke check (rustc host
  must be `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`; just/jq/gh/rg/yq versions), then
  `git diff --check`, with the four explicit packages above.
  No Nix/KWin/live tests in this job. Hosted runner preinstalled tools are
  **not** clean-runtime evidence [W10].
- **P:** Windows sessions touching shared code must pass these native gates
  plus all applicable Linux gates via user-authorized push/CI or the laptop.
  Report Linux gates pending until green; physical KDE/Windows acceptance is
  user-owned. Do not claim deferred gates passed. Root `just dev` remains
  Linux-only. Native loop: `just --justfile windows.justfile dev`, `dev trace`,
  `stop`; bounded owned-window journey: `proof`, under recorded live authority.
- The dev loop copies binaries before launch so builds do not overwrite running
  images. Explorer's desktop `Document.Application` broker keeps dev/test actors
  outside the protected Terminal tree; plain Shell.Application is caller-context.
  CLI `stop`/`emergency-stop` exit the verified owner only; call `restore` next
  (the Just `stop` recipe does both). Recovery state is per-user LocalAppData/session.

### 6. Configure opencode and smoke-test the actual agent environment

- **Settled (user 2026-09-30):** opencode installed via winget with the
  known-working configuration transferred. Keep Store PS7 shell resolution;
  do not configure an explicit opencode shell path.
- **V: O2:** global paths are `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and
  `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` (normally `$HOME\.config\opencode\...` on
  Windows). Transfer the user's existing global rules and named agents,
  adapt Linux paths and merge the snippets below; preserve provider settings.
- **V: O3:** processed-beef's documented plugin is
  `processed-beef@git+https://github.com/beefsack/processed-beef.git`.
  It registers skills, not agents. Restore the existing `gpt-sol` Lead and
  `muse-spark` Worker definitions/provider routing; full nesting uses
  `subagent_depth: 2` and appropriate task permissions. Do not invent model IDs.
- **O; U: O4:** reports cover Store pwsh -> 5.1 fallback, ripgrep extraction,
  Windows plugin cache paths containing illegal `:`, and Git/PATH casing.
  Reports are verified, their applicability/fix status on the chosen binary
  is not fully established. Fresh processed-beef Worker routing succeeded on
  this PC; this does not verify every permission rule. Installing
  rg on PATH does not prove opencode's internal bootstrap will use it.

```powershell
opencode --version
opencode debug config
```

- **P:** inspect effective config locally (it can contain secrets); restart
  opencode after changes. Ask the agent to make a shell tool call executing:

```powershell
$PSVersionTable
$PSHOME
Get-Location
Get-Command git.exe, rg.exe, rustc.exe, cargo.exe
rustc -vV
where.exe link
git status --short
```

- **P:** require `PSEdition = Core` from that **tool call**, not just Terminal;
  verify paths with spaces, dedicated glob/read/grep on `Cargo.toml`, skill
  loading, then one fresh read-only `gpt-sol` -> `muse-spark` Worker unit.
  Confirm effective task routing and permissions for both roles. A harmless
  `reg.exe query` request should be denied by the proposed rule; never probe
  an actual shutdown, policy write or destructive delete. Report failure.

### 7. Separate clean runtime from risky experiments

- **V: R4:** MSVC is genuinely native but defaults to dynamic C runtime.
  For the future Windows release binary, recommend target-scoped
  `-C target-feature=+crt-static`, with compatible native dependencies, to meet
  "no extra runtime installation". This is a build recommendation, not a
  Cargo change. In the VS environment inspect the actual executable:
  `dumpbin.exe /DEPENDENTS C:\path\to\actual-built.exe`. Only intended
  Windows 11 OS DLLs should be required, no VC redistributable/dev/MSYS DLLs.
  A staticlib `.lib` is not runnable runtime proof.
- **V: W11:** optional Windows Sandbox requires a supported edition
  (Pro/Enterprise/Education, not Home), BIOS virtualization, compatible CPU
  virtualization/SLAT, >= 4 GB RAM (8 recommended), two cores, >= 1 GB disk.
  Enable Windows Sandbox in Windows Features as a user/admin action; restart
  if prompted. It is a disposable test guest on the **PC**, not development
  in a VM or an assumption that the laptop can host one.
- **P:** map only the exact shipped-payload directory read-only, disable
  networking/clipboard in `.wsb`, copy payload into guest-local storage and
  run without installing Rust, Git, PS7 or build tools. Repeat on a clean
  machine if Sandbox is unavailable. Phase 1-3 proves startup/stop/restore on
  owned windows on the physical desktop first; Phase 4 repeats clean
  runtime there. **U:** actual runtime dependency closure is not yet proven.
- **V: W11:** closing Sandbox discards guest state; guest restarts retain it
  on Win11 22H2+, but writable mapped folders persist host changes. Avoid
  writable mappings. Win11 24H2 does not guarantee inbox Notepad/Terminal;
  bring the owned test harness. Verify process integrity: Sandbox's default
  user is an administrator, not proof of ordinary medium-integrity behavior.

| Phase 1 experiment | Environment and evidence limits |
| --- | --- |
| Clean binary startup; owned-window hide/reveal and forced-process-loss recovery | Physical desktop with owned disposable windows first (Phase 1-3). Phase 4 repeats clean-install/runtime in Sandbox when available. Discarding a guest is containment, not proof the independent restore path works. |
| Win+L policy | Deferred to Phase 4 Sandbox guest-only snapshot/write/readback/locking-API/restore experiment. **U:** redirected Win+L may reach the host; no primary guarantee of guest chord delivery or reliable guest unlock. Never modify host policy. |
| Win+Arrow, Snap/Start suppression, down/up and disable reversal | User's physical desktop; guest hooks see redirected input, not equivalent shell behavior. All four directions, ordinary integrity and game-disable proof. |
| Two monitors, mixed DPI, games/anti-cheat, UAC/secure desktop | Other Win11 PC (not this dev PC). Sandbox's one guest display is not the host's topology; vGPU/RDP is not physical game compatibility. |

### Verification checklist

- [ ] Windows live-test boundary decided; installed tools match this list and the latest-stable Rust policy.
- [ ] Agent tool call: Core PS7, correct `$PSHOME`, native executable paths.
- [x] `rustc -vV`: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc; stable default active in checkout, no override.
- [x] Native build/test/fmt/strict clippy pass; required Linux gates identified.
- [ ] `where.exe link` checked in ordinary and x64 VS environments; no foreign
  linker in the VS environment; Coreutils link disabled if installed.
- [ ] Git settings/origins, LF checkout/attributes, `core.longpaths`, short
  paths, clean status and `git diff --check`; no mass conversion.
- [x] processed-beef skills and fresh `muse-spark` Worker routing work with transferred config.
- [x] Dual-boot confirmed: Win11 Pro build 26200 + NixOS nixos-unstable.
- [x] Sandbox enabled, installed, rebooted, then closed 2026-09-30 after a failed preflight (user-dismissed WM_CLOSE; no processes remain); deferred to Phase 4 + Win+L guest-only. See [Phase 1 note](changes/windows-phase1-implementation.md).
- [x] Single-display M27Q baseline accepted 2026-09-30 (see top of this doc); multi-monitor moves to the other Win11 PC. Physical input/display/game acceptance remains pending.
- [ ] Clean-runtime and independent recovery evidence obtained when a runnable
  Windows spike exists; static CRT/OS imports are supporting, not proof. No
  Sandbox again this assignment. Host input/game gates remain pending until
  user-tested.

## Proposed PC global AGENTS.md section

**P:** append to the user's existing global rules, not replace them. Root
dependency/live-testing amendments remain separate user decisions.

```markdown
## Native Windows

- Use native PowerShell 7 Core for shell calls; verify $PSVersionTable in a tool call.
- No WSL, MSYS/Git Bash default shell or GNU Rust target for native builds.
- Use dedicated read/search/edit tools; otherwise PowerShell and named native tools.
  Call .exe explicitly when PowerShell aliases would change semantics. No assumed sed/awk.
- Dependencies follow the repo's Windows list; ask before installs, git-config,
  PATH, profile, registry/policy, security-setting or external-file changes.
- Build/test portable packages explicitly; root justfile/KWin/Nix gates run on Linux.
  Shared changes need applicable Linux evidence before acceptance.
- Do not execute input hooks, window movement/hiding or policy experiments without
  the approved Windows live-testing protocol and explicit scoped user authorization.
  Inspect build scripts/test targets before running; builds can execute code too.
- Prove independent stop/restore and out-of-hook recovery on owned test windows first.
  Never pause a hooking process in a debugger; no policy writes outside Sandbox.
- No broad deletes, security exclusions or changes to boot/session setup.
  Use the exact approved resource identity; ask on ownership/restoration ambiguity.
```

## Proposed opencode configuration

**V: O2/O5; P:** carry over the laptop's existing permission block and plugins
(`processed-beef@git+https://github.com/beefsack/processed-beef.git` and
`opencode-claude-auth@latest`), preserving `edit: ask`, `subagent_depth: 2`
and the existing bounded command allowlist. Merge these additions into the
PC's global `opencode.json`; do not replace the allowlist. `shell` applies to
agent shell tool calls; the permission key remains `bash` with PowerShell.
Patterns use literal command text and `*`, not regex alternatives. Keep the
existing `"*": "ask"` first and the deny rules last: last matching rule wins.
That catch-all already asks for deletes; `external_directory` defaults to ask.

Replace unavailable or differently behaving Unix command entries with the
PowerShell read-only equivalents below. **Only if Coreutils is installed**,
also add `allow` entries for `cat.exe *`, `head.exe *`, `tail.exe *`,
`ls.exe *`, `wc.exe *`, `sort.exe *`, `find.exe *`, `grep.exe *` and
`stat.exe *`. Use `Get-Command`/`where.exe` instead of assuming `which` exists.

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "bash": {
      "cargo fmt *": "allow",
      "Get-ChildItem*": "allow",
      "Get-Content*": "allow",
      "Select-String*": "allow",
      "Get-Command*": "allow",
      "Test-Path*": "allow",
      "Resolve-Path*": "allow",
      "where.exe *": "allow",
      "reg *": "deny",
      "reg.exe *": "deny",
      "regedit*": "deny",
      "Set-ItemProperty*": "deny",
      "New-ItemProperty*": "deny",
      "Remove-ItemProperty*": "deny",
      "shutdown*": "deny",
      "logoff*": "deny",
      "Stop-Computer*": "deny",
      "Restart-Computer*": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

- **P:** retain the existing bounded allows; no auto-approve mode or blanket
  `cargo *`/`git *` allow. Review project and per-agent rules; they can override
  global rules. For commands outside the allowlist, approve once rather than
  "always" for a broad interpreter/build prefix.
- **V/U: O5:** permissions are command patterns, not a security sandbox.
  Aliases, case/path forms, nested interpreters, scripts, native APIs and
  imperfect directory inference can evade narrow patterns. Default ask is
  the containment; inspect actual commands and effective version behavior.
  Registry/lock experiments are user-run inside the guest, not permission
  exceptions for the host agent. Restart opencode after saving.

## Windows live testing

Before live Windows work, read and follow [live Windows testing](live-windows-testing.md); it does not grant mutation authorization.

## Risk table

| Risk | Trigger | Containment | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CRLF/normalization churn | Git installer defaults or editor conversion | Proposed attributes, per-clone LF before checkout | Config origins, attributes, ls-files --eol, diff check |
| Wrong linker/native tool | Coreutils/Git usr-bin ahead in dev PATH; explicit override | Disable Coreutils link; Git Cmd PATH; VS discovery | Ordinary build plus first MSVC linker in x64 VS shell |
| Dependency/pin drift | Nix-only rule on Windows; rustup stable | Windows list in this doc, latest stable pre-1.0 (revisit at 1.0) | Versions/paths, workload/SDK inventory, both OS gates |
| Deep target path failure | Rust dependencies/build script uses legacy path API | Short repo/cache paths; Git longpaths is partial | Actual native build, OS policy readback |
| Desktop/input stranded | Hook hang, hiding, forced crash | Owned windows, independent restore/kill proven first | User live protocol and crash-recovery readbacks |
| Lock loss / invalid guest evidence | Win+L policy or redirected keyboard | Guest-only policy; no host writes; defer if unavailable | Guest exact restore; physical chord remains unproven |
| AV block / SmartScreen reputation | Low-prevalence unsigned builds; detection | Keep Defender/SmartScreen on; inspect own hash/detection, submit false positive | Windows Security history and Microsoft submission [W13]; **U** hook-specific keylogger heuristic, not guaranteed |
| Slow build | Scan-heavy repo/cache | Optional trusted Dev Drive performance mode, no broad exclusions | Drive query, Defender UI, measured build [W3] |
| Extra runtime dependency | Dynamic CRT/dev DLLs | Future static CRT and artifact-only clean guest/machine | dumpbin imports plus clean launch; hosted CI insufficient |
| Agent environment mismatch | Store alias, rg bootstrap, git plugin cache/path issue | Store PS7 with no explicit opencode shell path, official CLI, fresh smoke before delegation | Tool-call Core/version/path, dedicated search, skills and routing |
