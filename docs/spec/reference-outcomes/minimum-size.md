### R-MIN-01: newcomer minimum exceeds shares

- Given (tree profiles): Tiled `H[A*,B]`, inner area 1080x300, gap 8; A/B minima 500x100

- Given (column profiles): `COL[C1[A*],C2[B]]`, viewport 1080x300, gap 8; A/B
  minima 500x100; newcomer C minimum 100x100. Shipped defaults apply;
  viewport recorded. Full-rect prerequisite for a faithful projection: both
  columns fully visible at these widths before admission. An independent
  strip may instead scroll to show C, so tree-style member infeasibility is
  never assumed here.

- When: Open C with minimum 100x100.

- When (column leg): open C (same action as this scenario).

- Observe: Newcomer vs existing member infeasibility; which window floats, skips or overlaps; alternative arrangement considered or not

- Observe (column leg): newcomer vs existing member infeasibility; clamp, skip, overlap
  or reflow; focus.

- Then COSMIC: Traced allocation/cropping without minimum enforcement; fixed-size admission floats separately; admission maps once at the resolved MRU anchor (axis follows the anchor's realized long edge), no alternative search; `S(S-cos-min)` + `S(S-cos-last)` + `S(S-cos-axis)` + `S(S-cos-admit)`; exact axis/frames TBD (F: anchor realized frames plus output dimensions unrecorded; L: client settle timing)
- Then Hyprland/Dwindle: Tiled limits off by default; opt-in clamp/recenter may overlap/overflow, not auto-float; `S(S-hyp-min)`; exact fixture TBD
- Then bspwm: Hints default off `S(S-bsp-hint)`; opt-in clamps every leaf on reflow, including existing members `S(S-bsp-min)`; exact fixture/fence wiring TBD
- Then i3: Traced tiled render without minimum clamping; fixed-size min==max admits floating while ordinary resizable tiles; float min/max clamp is float-only; exact fixture frames/native response TBD; `S(S-i3-min)`
- Then xmonad/Tall+Navigation2D: Tall `tile` allocates unconditionally with no hint consult in the cited tile path (`tileWindow` move/resizes to the allocation unconditionally); ordinary resizable C tiles even when minima exceed shares (fixed-size/transient admission floats separately per `manage`; size hints shape only float frames via `floatLocation` through `applySizeHintsContents`); no alternative-arrangement search exists in the path; with focus A* C inserts above A (order `[C*,A,B]`), so tile allocations on the 1080x300 area are C `(0,0,540,300)`, A/B `(540,0,540,150)` each (xmonad ignores the fixture gap 8 - no gap branch in the cited path; allocations before border subtraction); all shares satisfy the declared minima, and any native client overflow/clamp settlement beyond the allocation stays TBD (L: client-side settlement, not in the tile path). `S(S-xmo-layout)` + `S(S-xmo-admit)`; queued.
- Then sway: Ordinary resizable C tiles unclamped even when minima exceed shares: tiled arrange fraction-normalizes with no client-hint consult (10px zeroing only, `MIN_SANE` 100x60 gap reservation only); fixed-size min==max admits floating instead (xdg parent/fixed-size; xwayland modal/dialog/utility/toolbar/splash/fixed-size at map, runtime hints urgency-only); float clamp is config min/max plus client hints on floating resize only; exact fixture frames/native response TBD; `S(S-sway-min)` + `S(S-sway-max)`
- Then qtile/Columns: Ordinary resizable C tiles unclamped even when minima exceed shares: tiled place runs with respect_hints=false (no client-hint consult in the Columns path); fixed-size min==max admits floating instead (X11 hint check; Wayland respect_hints is an unhandled TODO); exact fixture frames/native response TBD; `S(S-qti-min)` + `S(S-qti-float)`
- Then awesome/tile: Ordinary resizable C tiles prepending first (order `[C*,A,B]`, C master, A/B stacked; displayed start `H[A*,B]` implies prepared order `[A,B]`; newcomer focus via the shipped global rule) with size-hint shaping only (tile arrange applies hints without minimum-infeasibility float/skip, no alternative-arrangement search); fixed-size min==max floats implicitly instead; tile allocations on the 1080x300 area (shipped gap 0; the fixture gap 8 has no branch in the cited tile path) are C `(0,0,540,300)`, A `(540,0,540,150)`, B `(540,150,540,150)` before border/hint shaping, all satisfying the declared minima; any native client overflow/clamp settlement beyond the allocation stays TBD (L: client-side settlement, not in the tile path). `S(S-awe-tile)` + `S(S-awe-manage)` + `S(S-awe-float)`
- Then niri: column width resolves with min/max clamp (`S(S-nir-min)`);
  exact newcomer admission/focus TBD; queued.
- Then PaperWM: ordinary resizable C tiles unconditionally. `add_filter`
  has no fixed-size or minimum branch (Normal non-transient passes), so C
  admits as a new column at selected+1 RIGHT; the column layout sizes from
  the frame/preferredWidth with only a work-area clamp and never consults
  client minima, so no member floats, skips, or is refused by policy and
  no alternative arrangement is searched. Exact native frames/focus TBD.
  `S(S-pap-spc)` + `S(S-pap-ins)` + `S(S-pap-layout)`; frames queued.
- Then karousel/Lazy: ordinary resizable C tiles (no minimum-driven float, skip, or alternative-arrangement search); new column after the last-focused column (C1 under the A* focus, so between A and B); column width from C's preferredWidth clamped into [min,max] with the minimum capped at the tiling width; survivors keep widths; newcomer focus TBD (fixture states no protocol selecting the X11-manage vs Wayland-add fork). `S(S-kar-min)` + `S(S-kar-ins)` + `S(S-kar-fltanchor)` + `S(S-kwin-manage)` + `S(S-kwin-add)`; focus TBD (F: missing protocol selecting the newcomer activation fork).
- Then paneru: ordinary resizable C tiles as a new Single column between
  A and B (after-focus under the A* focus; no rule index under shipped
  defaults) with no minimum-driven float, skip or alternative-arrangement
  search; newcomer focus is synthesized to C. Exact native frames TBD
  (L: client-enforced minima). `S(S-pan-fresh)` + `S(S-pan-admit)` +
  `S(S-pan-stripwidth)`; frames queued.
- Then Ours KDE: Shared projection reallocates within the selected tree, without alternative-arrangement search; overconstrained members keep slots and writable members use tile origin with each extent at least its declared minimum (B6). Offline newcomer journey verified; exact native fixture/result TBD. Code: [adapter](../../../kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts) `overconstrainedEffective`, `writeGeometries`; [real-engine fixtures](../../../kwin/tests/workspace-send-engine-fixture.test.ts). Automatic victim/return policy unselected, `D(D-min-games)`.
- Then Ours Windows: Shared projection reallocates within the selected tree, without alternative-arrangement search; overconstrained members keep slots; Windows uses origin+minimum. Exact fixture/result TBD; automatic victim/return policy unselected, `D(D-min-games)`.
- Variant hook: V-START-MIN.

### R-MIN-02: shrink makes members infeasible

- Given (tree profiles): Tiled `H[A,B]`, inner width 1220, gap 8; both minimum widths 600

- Given (column profiles): `COL[C1[A],C2[B]]`, viewport width 1220, gap
  8; A/B minimum widths 600. Shipped defaults apply.
  Full-rect prerequisite: both columns fully visible
  at 1220 before the shrink. A strip may absorb the shrink by scrolling
  rather than by member infeasibility, so reflow is never assumed here.

- When: Shrink inner width to 1080.

- When (column leg): shrink the viewport width to 1080, then grow back to 1220 in
  the same fixture without a reset (wide-row shrink and recovery).

- Observe: Existing members become infeasible; native frames, focus, float intent and recovery after width grows

- Observe (column leg): infeasible members; clamp, overlap, focus and recovery on grow.

- Then COSMIC: Deterministic re-allocation with no minimum consult: equal-share `H[A,B]` (gap 8) allocates 606/606 at 1220 and 536/536 at 1080, infeasible against the 600 minima but with no clamp, float, skip, or refocus branch in the shrink path; grow-back re-runs the same allocation restoring 606/606 at compositor level. Whether native clients overflow, clamp, or misrender in response is client-side: exact settled frames TBD (L). `S(S-cos-min)` + `S(S-cos-add)` + `S(S-cos-flttoggle)`; settle queued (L)
- Then Hyprland/Dwindle: Same tiled clamp setting `S(S-hyp-min)`; default unclamped, opt-in recentered clamp; exact shrink/grow/focus TBD
- Then bspwm: Same per-leaf hint clamp when enabled `S(S-bsp-min)`; off by default; exact recovery/fence TBD
- Then i3: Same unclamped tiled allocation (float clamp float-only); exact shrink/grow frames/focus/float intent TBD (native response not in allocation source); `S(S-i3-min)`
- Then xmonad/Tall+Navigation2D: Same unconditional Tall sizing on shrink (pure `tile` recompute with no reflow clamp and no focus write, so focus is retained; the float map is untouched, so no shrink-driven float intent exists); tile-allocation widths are 610/610 at inner width 1220 and 540/540 at 1080 (`frac` 1/2 via `splitHorizontallyBy`; heights follow the unrecorded work-area height); exact native shrink/grow client frames and grow-back settlement stay TBD (L: native response not in the tile path). `S(S-xmo-layout)`; queued.
- Then sway: Same unclamped tiled allocation on shrink (fraction renormalize, 10px zeroing only; float clamp float-only including client hints on floating resize); exact shrink/grow frames/focus/float intent TBD (native response not in allocation source); `S(S-sway-min)`
- Then qtile/Columns: Same unclamped tiled allocation on shrink (no reflow clamp in the Columns path; hint clamp is float-only via respect_hints=true); exact shrink/grow frames, focus, and float intent TBD; `S(S-qti-min)`
- Then awesome/tile: Same hint-shaped tiled allocation on shrink (no reflow clamp or float intent in the tile path; pure `do_tile` recompute with no focus write, so focus is retained); tile-allocation widths are 610/610 at inner width 1220 and 540/540 at 1080 (`mwfact` 1/2; heights follow the work-area height); grow-back re-runs the same allocation; exact native shrink/grow client frames and grow-back settlement stay TBD (L: native response not in the tile path). `S(S-awe-tile)`
- Then niri: TBD (shrink clamp/reflow untraced). `S(S-nir-min)`; queued.
- Then PaperWM: shrink rewrites no column widths. The layout keeps sizing
  each column from live frames with only the work-area clamp and no client
  minimum consult, so neither member floats, skips, or is refused by
  policy; focus unwritten. Grow-back re-runs the same sizing from the then
  live frames, so restored widths follow whatever the native responses
  settled during the shrink: recovery TBD. Exact native frames/focus TBD
  (live-only). `S(S-pap-layout)`; recovery queued.
- Then karousel/Lazy: shrink rewrites no column widths by policy (`updateWidth` re-snaps to the closest preferredWidth clamped into [min,max]; no reflow clamp and no float intent); the strip absorbs the shrink via scroll; focus unwritten (stays); grow-back re-snaps from the then-live preferredWidths. `S(S-kar-min)` + `S(S-kar-scroll)`.
- Then paneru: the shrink applies no minimum-driven float, skip or
  refusal (no size predicate in the admission/model paths; minima only
  surface as runtime resize-shortfall observations); members keep their
  widths with the strip absorbing the shrink through the viewport, and
  focus is unwritten. Exact shrink/grow frames and grow-back recovery
  follow the live frames, TBD (L: client runtime). `S(S-pan-admit)` +
  `S(S-pan-stripwidth)` + `S(S-pan-colops)`; frames queued.
- Then Ours KDE: Same shared minimum projection; writable shrink-infeasible members use origin+minimum (B6), neither auto-floats. Offline shrink/grow recovery verified; exact native journey TBD. Code: [adapter](../../../kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts) `effectiveTargetFor`, `writeGeometries`; [real-engine fixtures](../../../kwin/tests/workspace-send-engine-fixture.test.ts). A hint-only change on KDE is not an independent dispatch trigger, `D(D-min-games)`.
- Then Ours Windows: Same shared minimum projection; current Windows origin+minimum, neither auto-floats. Exact shrink/grow journey TBD, `D(D-min-games)`.
- Variant hook: V-START-MIN.

### R-MIN-03: oversized sole minimum

- Given (tree profiles): Empty tiled domain, inner area 1080x600

- Given (column profiles): empty strip, viewport 1080x600; incoming A has declared
  minimum 1200x500. Shipped defaults apply; viewport recorded. A strip may
  show an overflowed sole column with scrolling rather than tiling it
  into the viewport, so sole-leaf tiling is never assumed here.

- When: Open A with declared minimum 1200x500.

- When (column leg): open A (same action as this scenario).

- Observe: Tile/flag vs automatic float; overflow remains even without siblings

- Observe (column leg): tile/flag vs automatic float; overflow with no siblings.

- Then COSMIC: Same tile allocation/cropping (ordinary resizable A tiles; fixed-size min==max exception is not an oversized-min policy); exact sole-leaf native frame TBD (F: output/work-area dimensions unrecorded for this leg; L: client settle timing)
  `S(S-cos-min)` + `S(S-cos-admit)`; frame queued (F+L)
- Then Hyprland/Dwindle: Same default-unclamped/opt-in-clamped tiling `S(S-hyp-min)`; native sole-leaf result TBD
- Then bspwm: Default hints off; honored hints grow leaf at origin `S(S-bsp-min)`; native exact frame TBD
- Then i3: Ordinary resizable A tiles unclamped even when its minimum exceeds the work area (fixed-size exception is min==max, not oversized-min); float clamp float-only; exact sole-leaf native frame TBD; `S(S-i3-min)`
- Then xmonad/Tall+Navigation2D: Ordinary resizable A tiles unconditionally even when its minimum exceeds the work area (sole entry takes the full rect via the `n <= nmaster` tile branch, so the tile allocation is the full `(0,0,1080,600)`; the fixed-size/transient float exception is min==max/transient only, not an oversized-min policy); `tileWindow` applies the allocation unconditionally, so overflow stays with the client; exact sole-leaf native client frame TBD (L: client-side settlement). `S(S-xmo-layout)` + `S(S-xmo-admit)`; queued.
- Then sway: Ordinary resizable A tiles unclamped even when its minimum exceeds the work area (fixed-size exception is min==max, not oversized-min; xwayland type/modal branches likewise admission-only); float clamp float-only; exact sole-leaf native frame TBD; `S(S-sway-min)` + `S(S-sway-max)`
- Then qtile/Columns: Ordinary resizable A tiles unclamped even when its minimum exceeds the work area (the fixed-size float exception is min==max, not oversized-min); exact sole-leaf native frame TBD; `S(S-qti-min)` + `S(S-qti-float)`
- Then awesome/tile: Ordinary resizable A tiles unconditionally even when its minimum exceeds the work area (sole entry takes the full `(0,0,1080,600)` rect; the fixed-size float exception is min==max only (transient affects tags/screen per `S(S-awe-manage)`, not implicit float), not an oversized-min policy); hint shaping only, so overflow stays with the client; newcomer focus via the shipped global rule; exact sole-leaf native client frame TBD (L: client-side settlement). `S(S-awe-float)` + `S(S-awe-tile)` + `S(S-awe-manage)`
- Then niri: TBD (sole-leaf oversized-minimum result untraced).
  `S(S-nir-min)`; queued.
- Then PaperWM: ordinary resizable A tiles even when its minimum exceeds
  the viewport. Admission has no minimum or fixed-size branch and the
  layout applies only the work-area clamp, so A opens as a sole tiled
  column (no automatic float); overflow stays with the client. Exact
  sole-leaf native frame TBD. `S(S-pap-spc)` + `S(S-pap-ins)` +
  `S(S-pap-layout)`; frame queued.
- Then karousel/Lazy: ordinary resizable A tiles as the sole column at the start of the empty grid (no minimum-driven automatic float; the minimum caps at the tiling width, so the column takes 1080); overflow stays with the client; newcomer focus TBD (fixture states no protocol selecting the X11-manage vs Wayland-add fork). `S(S-kar-min)` + `S(S-kar-ins)` + `S(S-kwin-manage)` + `S(S-kwin-add)`; focus TBD (F: missing protocol selecting the newcomer activation fork).
- Then paneru: ordinary resizable A tiles as the sole Single column (no
  minimum-driven automatic float; no size predicate in admission);
  overflow stays with the client and newcomer focus is synthesized to A.
  Exact sole-leaf native frame TBD (L: client runtime). `S(S-pan-fresh)` +
  `S(S-pan-admit)` + `S(S-pan-stripwidth)`; frame queued.
- Then Ours KDE: Core projects the sole leaf and flags its violated minimum; writable KDE raises the violated extent at tile origin (B6), allowing overflow. Offline oversized sole-leaf/offset-domain journey settles quietly. Code: [adapter](../../../kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts) `overconstrainedEffective`, `writeGeometries`; [real-engine fixtures](../../../kwin/tests/workspace-send-engine-fixture.test.ts). Floating cannot make this minimum fit the work area; exact native journey TBD, `D(D-min-games)`.
- Then Ours Windows: Core projects the sole leaf and flags its violated minimum; writable Windows raises width at tile origin. Floating cannot make this minimum fit the work area; exact native journey TBD, `D(D-min-games)`.
- Variant hook: V-START-MIN.
