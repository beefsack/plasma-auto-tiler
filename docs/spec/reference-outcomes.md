# Reference-WM Outcome Matrix

Purpose: canonical scenario/outcome evidence feeding a future
functional spec. It records observed or source-evidenced outcomes per
scenario for reference WMs and our KDE/Windows behavior. Variant hooks
are provisional, to discuss. Recorded decisions in
[decisions.md](../decisions.md) select supported variants and pending
configuration; a foreign outcome here does not automatically become
supported, and variants are spec hooks only, not implemented settings.

Row addition rule: add the shortest action sequence for an uncovered
behavior or ambiguity (reference WMs disagree, or our behavior is undecided).
Reuse existing coverage rather than duplicating a scenario with a
trivially different start state.

### R-FLT-06 Lead readings

Minimal variants of [R-FLT-06](reference-outcomes/floating.md#r-flt-06-float-toggle-over-a-maximized-window), recorded with the [B9 delivery](../changes/archive/maximized-intentional-unfloat.md). These qualify the ordinary-float row without changing fullscreen or sticky policy.

| Variant | Action sequence | Ours KDE offline outcome / Lead reading | References / native |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed explicit override | Admit fixed B as an automatic float; maximize B; toggle ordinary float off once; observe again | Clear maximize, observe clear, fresh-admit; successful explicit tile commits D3/D7 override, so B does not re-auto-float | Fixed admission floats per profile: COSMIC min-max `S(S-cos-min)`; Hyprland `suggestsFloat` min-max `S(S-hyp-float)`; bspwm fixed admission `S(S-bsp-admit)`; i3 fixed floats `S(S-i3-min)`; xmonad fixed/transient `S(S-xmo-float)`; sway `wants_floating` fixed `S(S-sway-max)`; qtile fixed-size rules `S(S-qti-float)`; awesome fixed implicit `S(S-awe-fixed-dynamic)`; niri `compute_open_floating` `S(S-nir-spc)`; karousel shapeability gate `S(S-kar-spc)`; PaperWM `add_filter` admits Normal non-transient only with rejects floating `S(S-pap-spc)` (fixed-size mapping TBD). Maximize legs per R-MAX-01 (bspwm/i3/xmonad/sway no maximize counterpart; PaperWM width-only `S(S-pap-widthmax)`; paneru host-only `S(S-pan-axfs)`). Toggle legs per R-FLT-06: COSMIC unmaximize-first `S(S-cos-flttoggle)`; Hyprland clear/re-apply retaining `S(S-hyp-float)`; qtile unfloat with maximize dropped `S(S-qti-float)` + `S(S-qti-fs)`; awesome explicit-only flip `S(S-awe-float)` + `S(S-awe-fs)`; i3/sway standard disable `S(S-i3-flt-toggle)` / `S(S-sway-float)`; niri plain move `S(S-nir-flttoggle)`; karousel state flip `S(S-kar-acts)` + `S(S-kar-float)`. Explicit-override commit has no reference counterpart (Ours-only); settled frames/focus TBD |
| Clear not confirmed | Intentionally float B; maximize B; toggle float off while clear is refused or remains unobserved; press again after normal state is observed | No admission on unconfirmed clear, float intent retained, logged narrow refusal with no stuck flight; later explicit press fresh-admits | No reference profile has an observation gate: each toggle path runs synchronously in source with no pending or refused-clear branch (COSMIC unmaximize-first `S(S-cos-flttoggle)`; Hyprland clear/re-apply `S(S-hyp-float)`; qtile unfloat `S(S-qti-float)`; i3 `floating_disable` `S(S-i3-flt-toggle)`; sway `container_set_floating` `S(S-sway-float)`; awesome `set_floating` `S(S-awe-float)`; niri plain move `S(S-nir-flttoggle)`; karousel state flip `S(S-kar-acts)`). Refused/unobserved-clear hold with later-press recovery is Ours-only; native clear ack and focus visuals TBD in every row (true runtime, live-only) |
| Sticky boundary | Make B sticky; maximize B; toggle ordinary float once | Existing sticky-maximize refusal unchanged; ordinary R-FLT-06 does not select a sticky policy change | Sticky legs per R-FLT-02: COSMIC output-set layer `S(S-cos-sticky)`; Hyprland float-only pin guard `S(S-hyp-pin)` (tiled pin refused); bspwm no float guard `S(S-bsp-sticky)`; i3 sets on any con but pushes floats only `S(S-i3-sticky)`; sway sets unconditionally but effective only when floating `S(S-sway-sticky)`; awesome orthogonal `S(S-awe-sticky)`; xmonad/qtile/niri/karousel/paneru no sticky verb (`S(S-xmo-float)`, `S(S-qti-float)`, `S(S-nir-acts)`, `S(S-kar-acts)`, `S(S-pan-cmds)`); PaperWM scratch stuck plus above plus float `S(S-pap-float)`. Maximize and toggle legs per R-MAX-01/R-FLT-06 above; the sticky plus maximize plus toggle combination itself is untraced in every profile, settled TBD |

### R-MAX-04 / R-FLT-02 KDE held-key discriminator

Minimal action sequence for the pending B1/B2 physical-repeat leg. The
[toggle activation decision](../decisions.md#window-state-float-sticky-maximize-fullscreen)
selects at most one native attempt per explicit activation; it does not
establish KGlobalAccel's held-key delivery or select a repeat-suppression policy.

| Variant | Minimal action sequence | Offline evidence | Physical outcome / remaining decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Held-key delivery | Focus ordinary eligible A; hold Meta+M past the repeat delay; release; press once again. From a fresh ordinary A, repeat with Meta+Shift+G | [KWin fixtures](../../kwin/tests/plan-adapter.test.ts) pin one native attempt per delivered maximize callback, repeated native restore/restick cycles and duplicate sticky notification convergence; existing sticky fixtures pin per-activation attempts | Ours KDE: callback count while held, visible cycling, release/repress delivery and any required suppression policy TBD, user-owned. Ours Windows: held repeats consumed without dispatch per the recorded decision; physical journey TBD. Reference WMs: this exact held-key sequence TBD; no source/native claim added |

### R-LAY-01 Windows held-key discriminator

| Variant | Minimal action sequence | Windows offline outcome / tentative decision | Unsupported / physical outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Held orientation toggle | Focus B in `H[A,B*]`; hold Win+O past repeat delay; release; press once again | Tentative, pending user review: one toggle on discrete down, consumed repeats do not retoggle; release/repress returns H. Classifier/queue tests 2026-10-11, base `755aab8` + delivery commit ([record](../changes/archive/windows-parent-orientation-toggle.md)) | Windows physical delivery/OS suppression TBD, user-owned. KDE held callback behavior and exact reference-WM held sequence TBD; no unsupported outcome inferred |

### R-CTL-05 M13 Lead readings

Minimal variants of [R-CTL-05/06](reference-outcomes/restart-persistence.md#r-ctl-05-shortcut-staging-and-apply), User 2026-10-08 M13 = B. Native store stays authoritative; these are offline KDE outcomes, not live acceptance or selected Windows runtime changes.

| Variant | Minimal action sequence | Ours KDE offline outcome / Lead reading | References / native |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keep custom / canonical | Assign a custom chord in KDE Shortcuts (repeat with canonical); keep row checked; confirm project Apply | Assignment unchanged; post-write verification compares the preserved image | No counterpart: pinned shortcut inventories define bindings only with no Keep/staging verbs, so a kept custom chord has no native leg; outcome TBD (owner-specific, project-only Keep). COSMIC `S(S-cos-shortcut)`; Hyprland `S(S-hyp-shortcut)`; bspwm `S(S-bsp-ctl)`; i3 `S(S-i3-bind)`; xmonad `S(S-xmo-ctl)`; sway `S(S-sway-bind)`; qtile `S(S-qti-keys)`; awesome `S(S-awe-keys)`; niri `S(S-nir-acts)`; PaperWM `S(S-pap-acts)`; karousel `S(S-kar-acts)`; paneru `S(S-pan-cmds)` |
| Keep empty | Clear a project's assignment (or observe unresolved empty registration); check Keep; confirm Apply | Stays empty; Keep never repairs or enables it | No counterpart: same binding-only inventories list no Keep/empty-repair verbs; outcome TBD (owner-specific, project-only Keep). `S(S-cos-shortcut)` + `S(S-hyp-shortcut)` + `S(S-bsp-ctl)` + `S(S-i3-bind)` + `S(S-xmo-ctl)` + `S(S-sway-bind)` + `S(S-qti-keys)` + `S(S-awe-keys)` + `S(S-nir-acts)` + `S(S-pap-acts)` + `S(S-kar-acts)` + `S(S-pan-cmds)` |
| Authentic intent | Customize or clear a binding; stage Authentic; decline Apply; then confirm fresh Apply | Staging/decline writes nothing; confirmed Apply writes canonical | No counterpart: no staged-Authentic/decline model in any pinned shortcut inventory; outcome TBD (owner-specific, project-only Authentic staging). `S(S-cos-shortcut)` + `S(S-hyp-shortcut)` + `S(S-bsp-ctl)` + `S(S-i3-bind)` + `S(S-xmo-ctl)` + `S(S-sway-bind)` + `S(S-qti-keys)` + `S(S-awe-keys)` + `S(S-nir-acts)` + `S(S-pap-acts)` + `S(S-kar-acts)` + `S(S-pan-cmds)` |
| Consumed Authentic | Stage Authentic; confirm Apply/Force successfully; customize in KDE Shortcuts with project Settings still open; confirm Apply again | Successful commit consumes reset intent; later Apply preserves the new custom chord. Failure/decline retains staged intent | No counterpart: no consumable reset-intent/commit model in any pinned shortcut inventory; outcome TBD (owner-specific, project-only Authentic). `S(S-cos-shortcut)` + `S(S-hyp-shortcut)` + `S(S-bsp-ctl)` + `S(S-i3-bind)` + `S(S-xmo-ctl)` + `S(S-sway-bind)` + `S(S-qti-keys)` + `S(S-awe-keys)` + `S(S-nir-acts)` + `S(S-pap-acts)` + `S(S-kar-acts)` + `S(S-pan-cmds)` |
| Compatible | Customize a nonconflicting row; stage Compatible; confirm Apply | Known/discovered conflicts disabled; nonconflicting custom assignments preserved, no replacements | No counterpart: no Compatible staging model in any pinned shortcut inventory (conflict lookup/unbind/mask verbs only, no staging); outcome TBD (owner-specific, project-only Compatible). `S(S-cos-shortcut)` + `S(S-hyp-shortcut)` + `S(S-bsp-ctl)` + `S(S-i3-bind)` + `S(S-xmo-ctl)` + `S(S-sway-bind)` + `S(S-qti-keys)` + `S(S-awe-keys)` + `S(S-nir-acts)` + `S(S-pap-acts)` + `S(S-kar-acts)` + `S(S-pan-cmds)` |
| Keep custom conflict | Give a project and foreign action the same custom chord; Keep; Apply; preview Force; confirm | Actual custom chord shown; Apply refuses; confirmed/revalidated Force removes only that chord from the foreign holder and preserves project assignment | No counterpart: no Keep/preview/Force foreign-clearing model in any pinned shortcut inventory (mask/unbind verbs only, no draft preview); outcome TBD (owner-specific, project-only Keep/Force). `S(S-cos-shortcut)` + `S(S-hyp-shortcut)` + `S(S-bsp-ctl)` + `S(S-i3-bind)` + `S(S-xmo-ctl)` + `S(S-sway-bind)` + `S(S-qti-keys)` + `S(S-awe-keys)` + `S(S-nir-acts)` + `S(S-pap-acts)` + `S(S-kar-acts)` + `S(S-pan-cmds)` |
| Stale Force / write drift | Preview custom conflict; change project/foreign assignment or staged intent; confirm Force (separately: change Keep during a selected write) | Stale confirmation refuses before writes; post-write drift fails verification without canonical reset | No counterpart: no stale-preview/write-drift revalidation model in any pinned shortcut inventory; outcome TBD (owner-specific, project-only Force; live timing-dependent). `S(S-cos-shortcut)` + `S(S-hyp-shortcut)` + `S(S-bsp-ctl)` + `S(S-i3-bind)` + `S(S-xmo-ctl)` + `S(S-sway-bind)` + `S(S-qti-keys)` + `S(S-awe-keys)` + `S(S-nir-acts)` + `S(S-pap-acts)` + `S(S-kar-acts)` + `S(S-pan-cmds)` |

### 2026-10-10 reference comparison discriminators

Minimal variants of existing R-MAX-08 and R-WS-23. Selected intent is recorded
below; shared-core/KDE delivery is offline, Windows wiring and native
outcomes remain pending ([record](../changes/archive/reference-comparison-implementation.md)).

| Variant | Minimal action sequence | Selected Ours KDE / Windows target | Reference / native evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Isolated maximized mover (G-06, R-MAX-08) | Prepare `H[A,B*,C]`, maximize B; move B right once without a preceding focus command | One unmaximize attempt, ordinary move only after observed clear in that invocation; otherwise narrow refusal/no structural move. KDE production-entry real-Engine fixture delivered offline; Windows pending | Existing R-MAX-08 traces COSMIC unmax-move and Hyprland refusal on still-focused maximized B; profiles whose focus step changed the mover do not establish this isolated variant. Other exact reference outcomes and both Ours native journeys TBD |
| Source MRU differs from order (G-37, R-WS-23) | L has occupied WS1, occupied WS2, trailing E; visit WS1 then WS2, migrate active WS2 to R; repeat fresh under each source-refill value | Default `last-remaining-workspace` shows E; `most-recently-used-workspace` shows eligible WS1 from L history. KDE production-entry real-Engine fixtures delivered offline; Windows pending | Existing R-WS-23 gives reference policies, but exact history-qualified outcomes for this added variant are TBD; Ours native journeys TBD |
| Source MRU fallback (G-37, R-WS-23) | Same source order; no eligible previous entry on L; migrate active WS2 to R with MRU selected; repeat with the remembered entry removed or migrated out of L's scope | Fall back to last remaining; do not recreate or follow an out-of-scope ID. Eligibility: pre-mutation previous stable ID must remain live in the source scoped ring excluding the migrated ID; surviving empty eligible, invalidated IDs excluded. Offline shared/KDE fixtures delivered | All exact reference outcomes and Ours native journeys TBD; global-history models are not substituted for the selected per-output model |
| Unconfirmed maximize clear (G-06, R-MAX-08) | Maximize B; move right while native clear refuses or remains unobserved; later press after restore | One attempt per invocation; log refusal, keep structural state, no delayed move. Later press can move. KDE refusal fixtures delivered offline | Exact reference and native failure-timing outcomes TBD |
| Surviving-empty MRU (G-37, R-WS-23) | Visit empty WS1 then occupied WS2 on L; keep WS1 live, migrate WS2 right with MRU | WS1 qualifies while still in the remaining source ring, even empty. If lifecycle removes it, fall back to last remaining; never recreate. Shared/KDE selector fixtures delivered offline | Exact reference outcomes and native lifecycle timing TBD |

### Tentative orchestrator discriminators 2026-10-11 (pending user review)

Tentative expected targets only, pending user review; no implementation
authorized. Ours and reference/native outcome cells below are TBD; no native
evidence is fabricated. These rows discriminate focus/visibility and store
lifetime, linking existing fixtures:
[R-INS-06](reference-outcomes/insertion.md#r-ins-06-open-over-an-overlay-maximized-plus-fresh-fullscreen-variant),
[R-CLOSE-05](reference-outcomes/close.md#r-close-05-close-a-maximized-or-fullscreen-window),
[R-ACT-01](reference-outcomes/activation.md#r-act-01-hidden-window-sends-an-unsolicited-activation-request),
[R-RST-02](reference-outcomes/restart-persistence.md#r-rst-02-end-session-restore-session-and-apps).

| Variant | Minimal action sequence | Tentative expected target | Ours / ref outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximize admission plus overlay close (D01) | Maximize focused B over survivor A; open C; close B | Admit C structurally behind retained overlay, ordinary newcomer focus; native stacking governs visibility, no forced unmaximize. Closing B removes its slot and refills/focuses survivors | Ours TBD; ref/native TBD beyond linked R-INS-06/R-CLOSE-05 |
| Fullscreen admission plus overlay close (D01) | Fullscreen focused B over survivor A; open C; close B | C admitted behind B without overlay writes or focus steal; B remains shown/focused until close. Closing B removes its slot and refills/focuses survivors | Ours TBD; ref/native TBD beyond linked R-INS-06/R-CLOSE-05 |
| Ordinary activation vs fullscreen/game-focused guard (D27) | From an ordinary hidden window, send one unsolicited activation; repeat while a fullscreen/game window is focused | Ordinary: switch and focus; fullscreen/game-focused: urgency-only guard | Ours TBD; ref/native TBD beyond linked R-ACT-01 |
| New-login intent scoped-store vs fallback (D26) | End session; start a new login and observe owned intent | Session-scoped store (REQ-RST-01d) cannot restore cross-login intent with no implicit namespace expansion; tentative fallback (b) listed known limitation applies to that leg unless a later design is authorized | Ours TBD; ref/native TBD beyond linked R-RST-02 |

### 0.1 package split discriminator (Settings decision pending)

| Variant | Minimal action sequence | Offline evidence | Desired / native outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native companion removed | Install core and companion; use Settings Fix once; close Settings; remove only the companion; open another ordinary window; choose tray Settings or KWin Scripts Configure | Core owns script/planner/tray; the script's `X-KDE-ConfigModule` and tray Settings depend on the companion KCM. Removal does not restore prior host keys. [Packaging record](../changes/archive/release-0.1-offline-packaging.md) | Tiling must continue and KWin remain stable per approved 0.1 gate; physical outcome TBD. Settings/Revert availability is a product decision, TBD; recommendation is a KWin-independent KCM in core or a non-effect settings companion. Reference-WM equivalents TBD, not inferred |

## Notation

- `H[a,b,c]` horizontal split, children left to right.
- `V[a,b,c]` vertical split, children top to bottom.
- Splits may hold 3+ children (N-ary). `H[H[a,b],c]` is a nested group.
- Focus marked with `*`, e.g. `H[A,B*]`. Order is identity order.
- Ratios shown only where load-bearing (e.g. `1/n` mover share).
- Actions are semantic (move/focus/send/float/maximize), not WM
  bindings; bindings differ per WM and are out of scope here.
- "no-op" means tree and focus unchanged. "TBD" means not established
  by the cited evidence; never read as a negative claim.
- Focus history means the per-domain MRU stack. Tests establish it by
  focusing windows in a stated order with focus moves before the action.
- Unspecified splits are equal, with no manual preselection, rules or
  minimum-size constraints. `S[A*,B]` means one tabbed tile, A active.
- Binary WMs cannot construct flat N-ary trees. For those rows use the
  same rectangles with a binary embedding and record that embedding;
  outcomes for the exact N-ary start remain TBD unless qualified.
- Startup fixtures below are proposed repeatable inputs, not recovered
  historical rectangles. Existing proof cells establish the policy,
  not a live execution of every new fixture. Rectangles are `(x,y,w,h)`
  in work-area-relative physical pixels, excluding decorations.

## WM profiles and config assumptions

Existing user tests often have unknown tested versions/config. Where
the tested version is unknown this file says so; today's source pins
are never applied retroactively to user-test cells.

## Evidence tags

Per-cell tags, kept terse via citation keys (legend below):

- `UT(date)` user-tested on that date (repo explicitly records the
  user ran that test). `UT(date-unrecorded)` where the repo records a
  user test but no date. Tested WM versions/config are unknown unless
  the source says otherwise. The 2026-08-20 date is repo-evidenced in
  `D-ref` (`[C-OBS-1]` screenshots, `[C-OBS-3]` transcript); the
  2026-08-22 date comes from screenshot filenames quoted in `D-move`
  Tests A-C.
- `S(key)` source read at a pinned commit, `key` maps to
  repo:path:line@commit in the legend.
- `D(key)` docs link/anchor, `key` maps to a repo doc path.
  This preserves the cited document's confidence level; an unverified
  community claim is not upgraded by copying it here. Linked corpus
  steps without UT are documentation evidence, not user tests.
- `TBD` unknown source behavior; stays TBD until evidenced.
- Mixed cells count once per evidence class present (e.g. a cell with
  `UT+S` counts 1 user-tested and 1 source).

  and 2x14 explicit-swap legs. Mutually exclusive semantic status totals:
  evidenced 372, partial 237, TBD-only 224, qualified-only 328, mixed 37.
  Mixed includes separate qualified/applicable legs; it does not mean a no-op.
- 522 historical wide-table cells at baseline `e160894` (eight references
  plus combined Ours per row) are migrated to GWT without retrospectively
  assigning the new status classes. Present form: 58 historical scenarios
  x 14 profiles = 812 Then bullets; 156 scenarios x 14 = 2184 Then bullets
  (+28 explicit-swap-leg bullets). Expansion record's total coverage count
  remains 1720 as baseline provenance; baseline assessed cells were not a
  uniform 125x14 grid. Baseline semantic-status totals above exclude the 22
  decision discriminators and the later Q3/Q4/R-WS-27 additions.
- [Archived expansion record](../changes/archive/reference-matrix-expansion.md)
  holds final accounting, source/inventory/native-test queue and residual work.

## Area files

Scenario rows live in area files under `reference-outcomes/` (58 historical
scenarios, migrated to GWT; plus 6 insertion scenarios from piece B1, 4 focus
scenarios from piece B2, 3 move scenarios from piece B3, 4 resize
scenarios from piece B4, and 4 layout-command scenarios from piece B5,
plus 7 workspace scenarios, 3 minimize scenarios, 2 maximize scenarios,
2 groups scenarios, 3 floating scenarios, 3 close scenarios,
4 multi-output scenarios, 3 mouse scenarios, 5 special-windows scenarios,
2 activation scenarios, 2 restart scenarios and 10 column scenarios, GWT
only: 125 expansion-baseline scenarios, plus 14 decision discriminators
2026-10-07, 8 Q2 fixed-size discriminators, 2 Q3 restart research
discriminators and 6 Q4 workspace migration discriminators 2026-10-08:
156 scenarios total (R-WS-27 two-candidate migration selection added User
decision 2026-10-09 with reference outcomes TBD).
This index retains purpose, row-addition rule, notation,
profiles, evidence tags/legend, variant hooks, and deferred. All 156
scenarios use the GWT form below; no wide-table rows remain.
Areas follow the approved priority order; column mechanics follows, and
minimum-size stays a supplemental file (not nested in resize).

## Scrolling column notation

Additive; the existing H/V/S notation is unchanged.

- `COL[C1[A],C2[B*,C],C3[D]]`: ordered columns, with C2's B/C vertically
  visible. Column identifiers persist through reordering.
- `COL[C1[A],C2[S[B*,C]]]`: tabbed-display column, distinct from both
  vertical visible stacking and a tree tab group. Accordion/overlapping
  display is an explicit profile-qualified rendering, never silently
  called tabs.
- Widths: `w(C1)=0.5W`, where W is viewport work-area width; absolute
  pixels only when load-bearing. Internal heights use ratios when needed.
- Viewport: `VP(x=0,W=2400)` is the strip-coordinate interval `[0,2400)`.
  State column positions/widths and gaps when clipping/ties matter; focus
  and viewport are separate state variables. No ambiguous inline boundary
  marker.
- Workspaces/outputs reuse `L:WS1=COL[...]`; paneru adds
  `Space1:{VW1=COL[...],VW2=COL[...]}`. Native Space and virtual row are
  separate domains.

## Cross-model projection rules

- H/V fixtures remain exact split-tree fixtures. A flat H has a matching
  projection to columns only if widths, visible windows, and viewport
  match; that proves rectangle-level behavior, not a split-tree. V can map
  to a visible multi-window column under the same qualification. Recursive
  H/V ancestry usually has no column counterpart.
- S maps only to a supported tabbed-display fixture with stated membership
  and active tab; PaperWM accordion and visible vertical columns are not
  exact S equivalents. Never flatten nesting just to obtain a result.
- Backfill assesses every existing row for each scrolling profile with a
  separately stated column Given; projections are marked explicitly and
  link any distinct column candidate.

## Outcome qualifiers

- `fixture-inapplicable`: no faithful start exists in that profile.
- `no-counterpart`: evidenced missing action or state (needs pinned
  inventory evidence).
- `owner-specific`: external journey outside the WM profile.
- None of these counts as an agreeing no-op. Applicable unknown outcomes
  stay TBD. Existing cells keep their current vocabulary.

## New-scenario format (GWT)

- Scenarios use Given/When/Then with one Then bullet per profile (14):
  COSMIC, Hyprland/Dwindle, bspwm, i3, xmonad/Tall+Navigation2D, sway,
  qtile/Columns, awesome/tile, niri, PaperWM, karousel/Lazy, paneru,
  Ours KDE, Ours Windows. Ours KDE and Ours Windows always have separate
  Then entries, never a combined verdict.
- Model-specific Given bullets and independently reset variant legs; never
  pretend every WM can instantiate one H/V fixture.
- This convention applies to every scenario, including single-step
  predicates. All 58 historical scenarios are migrated to this form;
  no wide-table rows remain.
- Attach `S(real-key)`, `D(real-key)`, `UT(actual-date)` only to
  established predicates. Partial evidence qualifies its leg; TBD stays on
  the unsupported part. Never invent citation keys.

## Scrolling baselines (VERIFIED at pinned sources)

Pins are source-read anchors, never retroactive user-test versions. The
eight existing WM pins are unchanged. Checkouts verified at exactly these
commits; PaperWM.spoon stays corroboration only, never a separate profile.

- niri @ed22699d99462f61ab171472d3ea67e844ea580d `S(S-nir-base)`:
  resources/default-config.kdl:123 (`center-focused-column "never"`),
  :129-132 (default presets 1/3, 1/2, 2/3 of output), :142
  (`default-column-width { proportion 0.5; }`).
- PaperWM @8bf6dd264f60d6c0c402b63df7b424b888959a48 `S(S-pap-base)`:
  shipped schema `open-window-position` default 0 (RIGHT of current
  window), `default-focus-mode` default 0 (DEFAULT). README right-of-active
  and `tiling.js` FocusModes corroborate; the schema is authoritative.
- karousel @8b9f0b62b2922703d7c25a79d5d49ae93cd3f93b `S(S-kar-base)`:
  src/lib/config/definition.ts:108-111 (`presetWidths` "50%, 100%"),
  :133-136 (`stackColumnsByDefault` false), :153-156 (`scrollingLazy`
  true), :158-166 (`scrollingCentered`/`scrollingGrouped` false).
- paneru @b1b6abbd3f1a4be138152b6f0389c9ff1b27a269 `S(S-pan-base)`:
  src/config.rs:1282-1284 (default width presets 0.25, 0.33333, 0.50,
  0.66667, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0), :799-808 (focus-follows-mouse and
  mouse-follows-focus enabled), :822-828 (native tabs enabled), :856-862
  (one workspace, append admission).

## Deferred areas

- All approved behavioral areas are assessed, including ratio balance
  (R-RSZ-04), workspace lifecycle (R-WS-03/10/13), and column mechanics
  (R-COL-01..10). Scrolling uses its own model, never assumed H/V equivalence;
  PaperWM.spoon remains corroboration, not a separate profile.
- Applicable unknown outcomes remain TBD. Source/inventory checks and native
  journeys are grouped by environment in the archived expansion record;
  qualified absent fixtures/verbs are not live no-op cases.
- Product choices remain pending batch review of the consolidated
  [consensus Table A](../research/reference-wm-consensus.md#table-a-strong-cross-family-consensus-where-ours-differs-24-consolidated).
- Historical-cell status recensus remains separate work; no retrospective
  status classes are assigned to migrated historical cells. Wide-table
  migration itself is complete.
- Gaps/borders/corners/active indication: metrics exist (`D-ref`
  section 9) but are styling, not behavior variants; out of scope.
- Fullscreen games bypass: all three agree cover-and-restore
  (`D-ref` section 10); no discriminating row needed now.
