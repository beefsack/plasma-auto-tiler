# Release 0.1 triage - batch 1 approved, remaining decisions tentative

Status: 15 units approved by User 2026-10-10; remaining 13 units, settings scope
and Proposal B tentative 2026-10-11, pending user review.
Original proposal base HEAD `4281e73`, report commit `27a97c4`.
No live tests run. Rules: 0.1-relevant = touches must-pass core KDE journey
([decisions](../decisions.md#scope-and-platform-goals)) AND current KDE
undefined/refusal/no-op/inconsistent/surprising; post-0.1 = niche,
scrolling-only/COL, Windows/macOS-only, already acceptable, parked (LAY-04).
COSMIC default unless references agree extremely strongly otherwise; user may
take a clear majority over a worse COSMIC mechanism. Alternatives shared by
>1 non-scrolling references get functional settings (WMs in tooltip); single
outliers, scrolling-only and model-only differences skipped with reason.
Gaming safety wins; overlap last resort; simplicity. TBD never invented.

Original proposal counts: 60/60 then-OPEN rows covered (32 relevant / 28
post-0.1); 28 decision units (D01-D27 + separate D28 MAX-09); 53/53 then-pending
checks (proposed M39 / K12 / W2). Batch 1 promoted 16 rows, leaving 44 OPEN.
Tentative decisions move 16 of those to PROVISIONAL and split out KDE D28 as
REQ-MAX-09b: current spec 121 NORMATIVE / 17 PROVISIONAL / 28 OPEN.

## User decisions 2026-10-10

- Approved exactly recommendation (a): D02 (SPC-01), D04 (INS-03), D05
  (INS-05), D06 (OUT-05), D07 (CLOSE-02), D08 (CLOSE-03), D11 (MOV-01),
  D14 (RSZ-02, RSZ-03), D15 (MOU-01), D17 (WS-09), D18 (WS-02b, no
  setting), D19 (FLT-13), D20 (FLT-12, no lower verb for now), D21 (FLT-14),
  D24 (CLOSE-04). These 15 units / 16 rows are now NORMATIVE in the
  [spec](../spec/functional-spec.md); implementation and native evidence remain
  distinct ([batch-1 work](../backlog.md)).
- Remaining 13 units pending: D01, D03, D09, D10, D12, D13, D16, D22, D23,
  D25, D26, D27, D28. No selection is implied by the recommendations below.
- Proposal B live-check classification (39 must-pass / 12 known-issue-allowed /
  2 Windows-release) and proposed new checks N1-N4 remain pending approval.
  Batch-1 verification checks added to the backlog are outside that original
  53-check inventory and are not classified by this unapproved proposal.
- Open meta-question to raise with D03: do new settings (D03, D09, D10, D12,
  D13, D27) ship in 0.1, or ship defaults-only with settings later?

## Tentative decisions 2026-10-11 (pending user review)

Tentative only, distinct from approved batch 1 above. No selection is
approved until user review. No implementation is authorized by this section.
Historical proposals A1/A2/A3/B and reference evidence below are preserved
unchanged; source observations are not marked as approved.

- D01 (a) tile behind overlay with explicit focus/visibility: maximize overlay
  retained with no forced clear, structural admission behind the overlay;
  C gets ordinary newcomer focus, with visibility governed by native stacking
  while B's maximize flag/reserved slot remain retained. In the fullscreen leg,
  fullscreen remains shown/focused with no overlay writes or focus steal.
  CLOSE-05 (a) removal with survivor refill/focus; joint native-cleanup live
  leg for both states.
- D03 default After focused. INS-04 (a) reapply the current policy each leg;
  legs 2-3 via the user live route.
- D09 default Geometric middle. D10 default Wrap. D12 default Extract to same
  axis. D13 default Wrap locally.
- D16 (a) retain float on transfer: 7/8 majority exception over COSMIC
  fresh-readmit for continuity/predictability; native host float roundtrip is
  the live leg.
- D22 (a) ratio-preserved reflow; disclosed thin basis: COSMIC observed plus
  I/S one family.
- D23 (a) minimize releases allocation and reflows with a stored restore slot;
  restore to the old slot with no focus steal; sole-workspace minimize retains
  the workspace with focus none. Windows retains allocation: observed
  divergence, tentative shared parity target, not user-approved.
- D25 (a) re-observe membership, keep the host-owned set, restore focus only
  where provable.
- D26 (a) restore owned gaps/settings/intent and re-observe host
  set/membership/max; fallback (b) is a listed known limitation if the full
  leg proves nontrivial. Cross-login disclosure: approved REQ-RST-01d
  session-scoped store prohibits new-login/KWin hydration, so cross-login
  intent cannot currently restore; no implicit namespace expansion. Tentative
  fallback (b) applies to that leg unless the user authorizes a later design.
  Settings/gaps and host re-observe legs verify.
- D27 default Switch and focus; fullscreen/game-focused urgency-only guard.
- D28 (a) keep the KDE fullscreen-send refusal as a listed 0.1 known issue
  pending the G-D2 native observation; no carry selected.
- Meta defaults-only 0.1: six settings (D03, D09, D10, D12, D13, D27) deferred
  to P2 `0.1 triage settings follow-up`; existing names/options/tooltips
  unchanged. Small-scope reason: defaults-only keeps 0.1 small; meaningful
  alternatives are still honored post-0.1.
- Proposal B tentatively adopted as the original 53-check classification
  M39/K12/W2 plus N1-N4 as M checks. With distinct N1-N4 additions the
  inventory is 57 checks => M43/K12/W2. Batch-1 verification extras remain
  outside that original inventory and are not classified here.

Reference key: C = COSMIC, H = Hyprland, B = bspwm, I = i3, X = xmonad,
S = sway, Q = qtile, A = awesome; `ev` = evidenced profiles, `fam` = families.
Consensus labels: B = strong consensus ours matches; U = strong consensus,
ours unresolved; W = numerical but not strong cross-family; C = listed
COSMIC differences without strong consensus; A = strong cross-family,
ours differs.
Tallies use [consensus](reference-wm-consensus.md), checked against the linked
per-WM action fills; observed COSMIC outcomes remain distinct from source
votes. Scrolling references do not vote. Inventory IDs come from the
[OPEN index](../spec/functional-spec.md#21-open-decisions-index).

## Proposal A2 - original decision units (one row per then-OPEN row)

Columns: KDE at proposal | COSMIC | tally + action source | options ->
recommendation. The User decisions section identifies approved units; others
await approval. Current implementation status is in the spec/backlog.

### D01 fullscreen admission + close cleanup (INS-06, CLOSE-05)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INS-06 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L79)) | admission over maximized/fullscreen TBD | TBD (all `B:full` legs TBD) | C audit-only; `B:max` no-counterpart B/I/X/S; [R-INS-06](../spec/reference-outcomes/insertion.md#r-ins-06-open-over-an-overlay-maximized-plus-fresh-fullscreen-variant) | (a) tile behind overlay with explicit focus/visibility rules, no writes/steal while fullscreen; (b) fail-closed queue until clear (confusing everyday-maximize no-ops); (c) disturb overlay (rejected: gaming). -> (a) for both states; joint native-cleanup live leg with CLOSE-05 |
| CLOSE-05 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L258)) | removal + desired focus sourced, native cleanup TBD | TBD (removal sourced, overlay cleanup TBD) | U full-leg-5/8 (H/B/I/Q/A) 3fam; [R-CLOSE-05](../spec/reference-outcomes/close.md#r-close-05-close-a-maximized-or-fullscreen-window) | (a) removal + survivor refill with focus; (b) explicit overlay-clear-first. -> (a); native fullscreen cleanup is the joint live leg |

### D02 transient dialog admission (SPC-01)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SPC-01 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L348)) | `normalWindow` mapping untraced | floats (`is_dialog`) | U float-8/8 4fam; [R-SPC-01](../spec/reference-outcomes/special-windows.md#r-spc-01-open-a-transient-dialog-then-request-parent-focus-fresh-modal-variant) | (a) float transients; (b) tile (no votes). -> (a); Windows owned-dialog exclusion stays documented divergence |

### D03 newcomer position + chained admission (INS-01b, INS-04)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INS-01b ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L74)) | order after/before focus TBD | after (source-proven `S-cos-add`) | U after-5/7ev (C,B,I,S,A vs X,Q; H EF), 4fam; [R-INS-01](../spec/reference-outcomes/insertion.md#r-ins-01-ordinary-third-window-admission) | Setting `New window position`: After focused (C,B,I,S,A) / Before focused (X,Q tooltips).

### D04 first admission (INS-03)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INS-03 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L76)) | single leaf + desired focus; native activation TBD | tiles full area + focuses (source-proven) | B unanimous 8/8 4fam; [R-INS-03](../spec/reference-outcomes/insertion.md#r-ins-03-first-admission-on-an-empty-workspace) | (a) native activate newcomer; (b) desired-focus only (risks dead keys). -> (a) |

### D05 float-focus anchor (INS-05)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INS-05 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L78)) | float holds no leaf; root-wrap fallback (differs) | anchor to tiling neighbor B (source-proven `S-cos-last`) | C audit-only; anchor C/I/S + H partial; B/X/Q/A TBD; [R-INS-05](../spec/reference-outcomes/insertion.md#r-ins-05-admission-while-an-ordinary-float-has-focus) | (a) anchor to nearest tiling neighbor (C/I/S direction); (b) keep root-wrap (inconsistent with approved long-edge-at-focus). -> (a) |

### D06 two-output open routing (OUT-05)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OUT-05 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L284)) | routing TBD | focused output + newcomer focus | U focused-7/8 4fam; [R-OUT-05](../spec/reference-outcomes/multi-output.md#r-out-05-open-a-window-with-two-occupied-outputs) | (a) focused output + newcomer focus; (b) pointer routing (needs journey). -> (a) |

### D07 fresh reopen (CLOSE-02)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CLOSE-02 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L255)) | reopen admission/focus TBD | fresh, no old-slot | U F8/8; [R-CLOSE-02](../spec/reference-outcomes/close.md#r-close-02-close-refocus-fresh-reopen) | (a) fresh admission; (b) old-slot restore (no votes). -> (a) |

### D08 sole close (CLOSE-03)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### D09 nested move entry (MOV-06)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MOV-06 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L111)) | midpoint insert, index TBD | geometric middle index (source-proven `S(S-cos-move)`: `V[B,A*,C]`) | C audit-only 3-way: enter I/S vs leaf-swap B/A vs Q carry; [R-MOV-06](../spec/reference-outcomes/move.md#r-mov-06-move-into-a-nested-perpendicular-neighbor-with-remembered-child) | Setting `Nested move entry`: Geometric middle (COSMIC) / Remembered child (i3, sway; insertion side differs) / Swap target leaf (bspwm, awesome; exact target differs, awesome tile-projected). Insert grows the neighbor group; swap preserves its size. Q carry single: skip. Default middle. -> approve |

### D10 orthogonal escape (MOV-07)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MOV-07 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L112)) | wrap outcome TBD | wraps via R1 mismatch fork (source-proven `S(S-cos-move)`: `V[H[A,B*],C]`) | C audit-only 2-2: escape I/S vs down-swap B/A; [R-MOV-07](../spec/reference-outcomes/move.md#r-mov-07-orthogonal-escape-across-a-perpendicular-parent) | Setting `Orthogonal escape`: Wrap (COSMIC) / Escape outward (i3, sway) / Swap target leaf (bspwm, awesome; awesome tile-projected). Wrap changes the ancestor layout; escape promotes the mover; swap exchanges leaves without promotion. Default wrap. -> approve |

### D11 flat-triple perpendicular (MOV-01)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MOV-01 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L106)) | behavior TBD | observed restructure `V[H[A,C],B]` via R1 (`UT(2026-08-20)` + conformance S1) | C audit-only historical tie R2/N2: restructure I/S vs model-policy Q/A; current fills also establish B no-target no-op, Q/A exact flat-triple outcome TBD; [R-MOV-01](../spec/reference-outcomes/move.md#r-mov-01-perpendicular-move-of-a-flat-triple) | (a) restructure (COSMIC-observed, i3, sway); (b) no-op at edge (bspwm exact fixture). Q/A in-column policies have no ordinary flat-triple fixture: model differences, no setting. -> (a); changes root orientation rather than refusing an ordinary move |

### D12 ancestor escape (MOV-04)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MOV-04 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L109)) | escape/retain TBD | observed `H[A,B,C]` via R3 ascend + same-axis flatten (`UT(2026-08-20)` + S1-03) | C audit-only: retain H/B vs partial-extract I/S; Q carry + A swap/miss singletons skipped; [R-MOV-04](../spec/reference-outcomes/move.md#r-mov-04-same-axis-ancestor-escape) | Setting `Same-axis escape`: Extract to same axis (COSMIC-observed, i3, sway) / Retain nesting (Hyprland, bspwm; H reinserts into binary nesting, B swaps with C). Default extract. Known-issue hold alternative only with approval. -> approve |

### D13 perpendicular move at output edge (OUT-02)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OUT-02 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L281)) | local-vs-cross TBD | observed no-cross, local R1 (`S21-01` authored observation) | C audit-only: wrap I/S vs cross B/A; Q local-split; H/X TBD; [R-OUT-02](../spec/reference-outcomes/multi-output.md#r-out-02-perpendicular-move-at-an-output-edge) | Setting `Perpendicular edge move`: Wrap locally (COSMIC-observed, i3, sway) / Cross output (bspwm, awesome). Default wrap (product-preferred COSMIC-observed; cross is 2/8, not extremely strong). -> approve |

### D14 resize edges (RSZ-02, RSZ-03)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSZ-02 ([spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L123)) | outward no-op TBD | no-op (source-proven) | W weak 3/4ev 2fam (C,I,S vs Q redistribution); [R-RSZ-02](../spec/reference-outcomes/resize.md#r-rsz-02-outward-resize-at-the-work-area-edge) | (a) outward no-op; (b) redistribution (Q single - skip). -> (a) |

### D15 hover vs click focus (MOU-01)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### D16 floating transfer (WS-05)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### D17 workspace return focus (WS-09)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |

Q/A establish verb availability, not competing policies for the same action; no settings exemption based on family count. -> (a) |

### D21 pointer float drag/resize (FLT-14)

| Row | KDE current | COSMIC | Tally / source | Options -> recommendation |

Scopes: INS-07 no-steal covers tiling-admission into inactive workspaces only - not overapplied to existing-window activation. Gaming guard: urgency-only while a fullscreen/game window is focused (gaming safety justifies this guarded deviation). Default switch. -> approve |

### D28 fullscreen send observe-first (MAX-09, separate)

MAX-09 maximized leg NORMATIVE (flag-stable carry delivered offline;
[spec](../spec/functional-spec.md#L223)); fullscreen leg OPEN observe-first,
currently refuses fullscreen sends. Table A carry-5/8 (B,I,S,Q,A) 3fam
([R-MAX-09](../spec/reference-outcomes/maximize-fullscreen.md#r-max-09-send-a-maximizedfullscreen-window-to-another-workspace)); H/C
TBD; COSMIC carry untraced; KDE native-send untraced.
Explicit approval ask (no product change proposed): (a) hold the current
fullscreen refusal for 0.1 as a listed known issue pending the G-D2 native
observation (fail-closed, gaming-safe); (b) gated carry behind observation
risks fullscreen writes during games. -> (a); carry policy selected only
after observation.

## Proposal B - pending live checks (53 top-level; M39 / K12 / W2)

Gate: VISION sleep/wake, plug/unplug, resolution/scaling, fullscreen apps,
underlying config ([VISION](../../VISION.md#reliability)); core tiling,
focus/move, workspaces, multi-output, border, shortcuts, settings, restart;
FX = missing/failed/removed effect keeps tiling working + KWin stable.

Verdicts: M = MUST-PASS; K = KNOWN-ISSUE-ALLOWED, only if listed and no
crash or silent tiling stop; W = Windows-release, outside KDE 0.1.

Packaging (separate, not in Pending checks): external NixOS/HM validation
P1 in gate; mainstream packaging P1 per 2026-10-10 scope.

### Gate coverage vs exact gaps

| Gate category | Existing checks | Exact gap -> new check (M) |
|---|---|---|
| sleep/wake | 30, 50 | covered (add game-present combo only: N3) |
| plug/unplug | 51 (+14 hotplug legs) | covered |
| resolution/scaling | 34 (work-area gate), 44 | covered; overlay interplay untested: N4 |
| fullscreen apps | 9, 13, 45, 34 | covered |
| underlying config | 22 (Fix/Revert flow), 12 (Save path) | external/bypass edits untested: N2 |
| gaming non-interference | 9, 31, 34, 45 | covered (+N3 combo) |
| tiling/focus/move/ws/multi/border/shortcuts/settings/restart | 1, 2, 6-8, 10-23, 25-27, 31-33, 39, 42-49 | covered |
| FX missing/failed/removed effect | 28 (failed endpoints), 53 (partial) | missing-at-startup, explicit disable, package remove untested: N1 |

Proposed new checks (user-owned; additional legs, not a new release gate):

| Check | Verdict | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 effect-absent | M | Start with effect missing/disabled; disable mid-session; remove optional effect package; exercise failed endpoint with check 28 | Tiling keeps working throughout; KWin stable |
| N2 external config | M | Change host configuration outside Settings, then reconfigure | Validated reconcile without unintended writes; Fix/Revert ownership respected; no crash or silent stop |
| N3 sleep + gaming | M | Sleep/wake with fullscreen game and tiled session | Game unimpeded; tiling recovers; no stuck holds |
| N4 scaling + overlays | M | Change scale with maximized/fullscreen/fixed-float windows | Overlays retained; no fullscreen geometry writes; quiet settlement |

## Limitations

No live tests run. Tallies reproduce via consensus voter lists + anchored
action rows. Thin/disclosed: FLT-03 (COSMIC-observed, 1-family source),
MNZ-02 (2/2ev scoped), MNZ-03 (COSMIC source-proven, no multi tally),
INS-07b (0/8, post). Surprises: WS-05 COSMIC-outlier (majority exception);
MNZ-01 direction corrected (release, not retain); OUT-02 COSMIC-observed
wrap (not cross); RST-02 consensus C audit-only, with the new tentative clause
recorded separately from reference evidence.
