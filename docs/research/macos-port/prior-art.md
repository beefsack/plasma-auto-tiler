# macOS window-management prior art

Status: researched 2026-10-03, source inspection only. Upstream behavior is
not a macOS guarantee or our acceptance evidence. Unknown means not established
from the fetched sources. Recommendations live in the [tentative plan](plan.md).

Recommended architecture, not newly approved: public AX, no reduced SIP;
managed per-display workspaces mandatory for feature-complete; underlay
experiment with outline fallback; same KDE actions/behavior; modifier mapping
open; per-binding shortcut conflict list decided 2026-10-03; gaming needs no
overlays/moves/input interference.

## Per-project source notes (fetched specifics)

- AeroSpace: Package.swift pins `soffes/HotKey` exact 0.2.1; AppBundle links HotKey product.
  HotKey README: "wraps the Carbon APIs for dealing with global hot keys".
  private.h declares `AXError _AXUIElementGetWindow(AXUIElementRef, uint32_t *)`
  (the single private fn; README says everything else is public AX). README:
  not notarized by author choice, a distribution fact separate from API surface.
- yabai README requirements table: Intel Big Sur 11+ / ARM Monterey 12+ through
  Tahoe 26; Accessibility mandatory + restart; Screen Recording iff animations;
  separate Spaces must be ON. SIP wiki (edited Apr 2026): injection into
  Dock.app owns window-server connection; SIP-gated list = space/layer/sticky/
  shadow/transparency/animation/scratchpad/PiP; per-arch csrutil variants.
  Keyboard: external skhd (README points at asmvik/skhd).
- Amethyst: HotKeyRegistrar.swift migrates MASShortcut defaults to
  KeyboardShortcuts (`KeyboardShortcuts.Name`, `setShortcut`, `onKeyUp`) with
  `override` path breaking MASShortcut bindings. Package.resolved pins
  KeyboardShortcuts 2.2.4, MASShortcut (shpakovski master), Silica (ianyh
  master), Sparkle 2.9.5. HotKeyManager.swift maps NSEvent modifiers to Carbon
  `shiftKey/cmdKey/optionKey/controlKey`. Space.swift: `CGSSpaceID /
  CGSSpaceType` from Silica. Silica ships private CGS headers (CGSSpace.h,
  CGSWindow.h, CGSHotKeys.h) plus a CGSInternal submodule.
- Rectangle README: uses rxhanson/MASShortcut fork (upstream archived) + Sparkle
  via SPM for shortcut recording and updates; Pro is a separate proprietary
  product built on top. Explicit no-cross-Space-moves statement in README.
- Hammerspoon libhotkey.m: `RegisterEventHotKey(keycode, mods, {sig 'HMSP',
  monotonicID}, GetEventDispatcherTarget(), kEventHotKeyExclusive, ...)` with
  `InstallEventHandler` for pressed/released; key repeat synthesized with
  NSTimer (`keyRepeatDelay`/`keyRepeatInterval`). spaces/private.h declares SLS*
  externs; libspaces.m calls `SLSMainConnectionID`,
  `SLSCopyManagedDisplaySpaces`, `SLSMoveWindowsToManagedSpace`,
  `SLSCopySpacesForWindows`, `SLSGetActiveSpace`, plus Sonoma-14.5+ path via
  `SLSSpaceSetCompatID`/`SLSSetWindowListWorkspace`. HSuicore.m calls private
  `_AXUIElementGetWindow` during window construction and snapshots; geometry
  uses AX. libwindow.m adds private `CGSSetDebugOptions` for shadows. These
  identity/Spaces helpers must not be copied into a public-only adapter.
- Loop: `BaseEventTapMonitor` manages CFMachPort taps with `CGEvent.tapEnable`,
  run-loop sources, and restart-cascade guard; Event Monitoring folder holds
  Active/Passive/Local monitors on an EventTapThread. AccessibilityManager
  tracks `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` + AXPermissionsChanged notifications.
  Loop.entitlements is empty (AX is runtime consent, not an entitlement).
  `Loop/Private APIs` holds SkyLightBridgedSPI/SymbolLoader/ToolBelt,
  SLSWindowTags, PrivateApis.swift: private SkyLight without SIP change,
  version-coupled like other SLS consumers.
- FlashSpace: project.yml deps include `wojciech-kulik/KeyboardShortcuts`
  (branch main) + Sparkle + TOMLKit/Yams; MARKETING_VERSION 4.18.79, macOS 14+.
  Accessibility folder holds AXUIElement/NSRunningApplication wrappers.
  Entitlements disable sandbox only. README design notes: no per-window or
  layout management by design (UNIX philosophy); PiP workaround parks windows
  in a screen corner; tips point at SKHD + CLI + Raycast extension.
- Phoenix: PHKeyHandler.m registers Carbon hotkeys (sig 'FNIX',
  `kEventHotKeyExclusive`) with first-come exclusivity handling and NSTimer
  repeat; PHGlobalEventMonitor.m uses `addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask`
  for mouse events only. Commit 2025-08-31 deprecates `Space#moveWindows` on
  13.6+/14.5+/15.0+. LICENSE.md is MIT with an app-icon carve-out.
- Glide ARCHITECTURE.md: sys layer wraps AXObserver/AXUIElement,
  CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo, private SkyLight, event tap, CFRunLoop executor;
  WmController owns hotkey registration (capture API unnamed: Unknown);
  CGEvent tap covers mouse (focus-follows-mouse, warp). Dual Apache-2.0/MIT.
- komorebi-for-mac (branch master): macOS tiler in Rust with `komorebic` CLI,
  UDS event subscriptions, client crate; public releases repo plus private
  KomoCorp nightly repo for sponsors. LICENSE.md is Komorebi 2.0.0 text
  (permitted-purpose + personal-use clauses); README adds the commercial-use
  paid-license path. Key-capture substrate: Unknown from fetched page.
- Swindler: MIT library, cached AX model; Spaces 0% per README scope; latest
  commit 2022-09-06 (stale alpha). No hotkey role (N/A).
- Related library AXSwift (MIT): thin Swift wrapper of the C AX client API,
  explicit errors, no cached state or workspace policy. Swindler builds on it;
  neither is a Rust adapter or a substitute for identity/recovery proof.
- Paneru: MIT; per-monitor strip, sliver workaround, native-Space compatible;
  key bindings in TOML/Lua, capture substrate Unknown from fetched README.
- JankyBorders: GPL-3.0; border.c calls `SLSReleaseWindow` and other SLS fns:
  private SkyLight ordering without SIP change, version-coupled.
- skhd: event_tap.c creates `CGEventTapCreate(kCGSessionEventTap,
  kCGHeadInsertEventTap, ...)`; skhd.c taps KeyDown + NX_SYSDEFINED with
  tap-disabled restart, requires AX (`AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions`), aborts
  when Secure Keyboard Entry is set (`CGSIsSecureEventInputSet`), refuses root.
  hotload.c watches config via FSEventStream. carbon.c only tracks front-app
  switch. MIT; maintenance-mode banner; owner renamed koekeishiya to asmvik.

## Cross-cutting contrast (decision input, not a decision)

- Not all less-jank routes need SIP changes. yabai Dock injection needs partial
  SIP disable, but SkyLight/SLS consumers (Hammerspoon spaces helpers,
  JankyBorders, Loop private APIs, Glide detection, AeroSpace's single helper)
  install and run under stock SIP; they are version-coupled instead. Do not
  portray private-API use as SIP-gated, and do not portray public AX as the
  only stock-SIP path.
- Public AX lowers the system/security burden (no injection, no private
  linkage) but is not an installability guarantee: Accessibility consent is
  still required and MDM can deny it. Notarization is a distribution
  property, not App Store approval and not a statement about API surface
  (AeroSpace ships unnotarized by author choice while using mostly public
  API plus one private helper).
- Lower-level routes can avoid some animations (hide/show without moves,
  ordering without polling) but that does not guarantee less jank. Private
  routes add version coupling; AX routes add client latency and non-atomic
  resizing; parking adds visible slivers/shell effects. Input taps have a
  separate timeout/Secure Input risk. These are tradeoffs, not a ranking.
- Keyboard: discrete Carbon-style registration (Hammerspoon, Phoenix,
  AeroSpace via HotKey lib, Amethyst/Rectangle/FlashSpace via
  MASShortcut/KeyboardShortcuts deps) cannot intercept or suppress system
  chords the way an active session event tap can. Verify actual system-chord
  ownership and tap-mode TCC requirements per OS; project AX permission lists
  are not proof of every input mode. See the [setup runbook](../../macos-dev-environment.md).
- Corporate/distribution: Apple's PPPC payload can allow or deny Accessibility
  and input access by signed identity; stock SIP alone does not establish MDM
  installability. App Store rules require sandboxing (2.4.5) and public APIs
  (2.5.1), with alternate-desktop review exposure (2.5.8). Developer ID signing
  and notarization are a separate direct-distribution path, not Store approval.

## Source gaps (do not fill by inference)

- Exact key-capture substrate still Unknown after README-level reads:
  Rectangle Pro, komorebi-for-mac, Paneru, Glide (WmController unnamed).
  FlashSpace names its KeyboardShortcuts dep; the capture API inside that fork
  was not opened here.
- Rectangle Pro and komorebi-for-mac window-control internals: not stated on
  fetched pages. Closed-source stays Unknown (Rectangle Pro).
- Glide canonical home: tmandry/glide and glide-wm/glide both visible with
  recent commits. Confirm the maintained home/revision before reuse.
- License texts opened for all rows except Rectangle Pro (proprietary page,
  no license text) and dep libs (soffes/HotKey README states MIT; full dep
  license texts not opened).
- Dated evidence is latest-commit visibility on fetched feeds, not an
  activity verdict. Swindler (2022-09-06) is the only clearly stale tree.
