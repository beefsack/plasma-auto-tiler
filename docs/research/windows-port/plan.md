# Windows port: decision plan

Status: research updated 2026-09-30. User-selected directions are in
`docs/decisions.md`; unproven APIs remain spikes. Builds on
[cross-platform feasibility](../cross-platform-support/feasibility.md) and the
[portable-policy audit](../cross-platform-core/extraction.md). `VISION.md`
requires tiling, groups, borders, shortcuts and workspaces, with no impact on
fullscreen gaming. Existing KWin decisions remain in `docs/decisions.md`.
This plan distinguishes approved goals from untested implementation choices.
The matching [macOS plan](../macos-port/plan.md) compares host constraints;
the [core extraction audit](../cross-platform-core/extraction.md) now includes
a three-host capability and sharing comparison.

**Answer [user decision 2026-09-30]:** Windows 11 x64, developed on the
physical Windows test system after KDE-first core extraction. Managed per-monitor
workspaces are required for feature completeness. Win+Arrow is opt-in but
must work for this user's feature-complete experience. Keep Win+L and a real
underlay as experiments, with explicit Win+L opt-in and an accepted group
outline fallback. Private virtual-desktop APIs remain out of the release path.

## Evidence key and baseline correction

The earlier feasibility study is a useful starting point; its Windows scope
needs a first-class workspace gate, and Win+L needs a separate policy choice.

- **V**: documented vendor API or checked license. **O**: upstream issue or
  implementation, not a Windows guarantee. **I**: proposal or unverified
  behavior. Source keys are listed below; checked 2026-09-29.
- [V: W5,W6; O: U1] The 2026-09-17 study correctly left cross-process
  `DWMWA_CLOAK` open and identified the public virtual-desktop limit.
  Managed workspaces still need shell and recovery proof.
- [I: `VISION.md:15`, `docs/decisions.md:689-727`] Its native-current-desktop
  scope is a good prototype but does not deliver per-output workspaces.
  KDE's Lock Session relocation does not by itself prove Win+L can be
  relocated; see the policy options below.
- [V: W21; user decision 2026-09-30] Windows 10 Home/Pro support ended
  2025-10-14. Windows 11 x64 is the selected target; the user may revisit it.

## Development and iteration

Day-one native setup, governance decisions and verification: [Windows development environment](../../windows-dev-environment.md).

Develop natively on the selected Windows 11 test system. It is also the historical KDE
multi-output host (DP-6 and HDMI-A-2); that historical assertion is unchanged,
and the current single Windows display is not proof of a present wiring change.
**Settled (user 2026-09-30):** this test system dual-boots
Windows 11 Pro x64 build 26200 and NixOS nixos-unstable. Develop on one display
here (accepted display baseline in the [runbook](../../windows-dev-environment.md));
Windows multi-monitor work moves to the user's other Win11 test system. A VM is optional,
not the safety net.

- [V: W33] Install the official `rustup` MSVC x64 toolchain, Visual Studio
  Build Tools with **Desktop development with C++** and the Windows SDK.
  Install `just` using its documented Windows distribution, with versions
  pinned alongside the future Windows build contract. The Linux toolchain
  remains managed by `devenv.nix`; no Windows build tools go into it.
- [I] Keep separate NixOS and Windows working copies and synchronize *source*
  through Git; do not share `target/`, live settings, ownership receipts or
  compiled effects across operating systems. Windows and KDE cannot be tested
  concurrently: switch sessions deliberately and re-establish each OS
  baseline. A separate Windows install/test system avoids rebooting but does not make
  Windows monitor IDs equal to KDE's DP-6 and HDMI-A-2. Verify the single Windows
  display identity on this test system; verify multi-monitor identities only on the other Win11 test system.
- [R: milestone 2] Windows-specific PowerShell justfile:
  `just --justfile windows.justfile dev` builds with
  `cargo build -p tiler-windows`, exits the verified dev owner, restores,
  copies the new payload, starts via Explorer's desktop broker, checks ready
  state and prints the log path. This keeps actors outside the protected Terminal tree.
  `just --justfile windows.justfile dev trace` adds redacted tracing;
  `just --justfile windows.justfile stop` exits the owner then independently
  restores owned windows. Hooks and overlays are not implemented yet. The existing root `justfile` sets `bash` globally
  and uses Linux-specific tools; do not route Windows through it unchanged.
- [I] On the daily-use system, start with dedicated test apps where practical;
  first experiments must not hide real user windows. Keep a desktop/Start
  recovery shortcut outside the hotkey hook: `tiler-windows restore` reads
  the owner-tagged visibility ledger and reveals only verified project-hidden
  windows, even if the primary process has exited. `tiler-windows stop`
  requests graceful release; if unresponsive,
  an emergency stop targets only a verified dev-process identity, then runs
  the standalone restore path. Disable dev login startup before testing an
  intentionally crashing build. Prove recovery before allowing ordinary
  apps, workspace hiding or restart automation.
- [I: W7-W9] Native Windows handles DWM, Explorer, Snap, User Account
  Control (UAC), games and physical shortcut acceptance. Linux cross-compile
  (`cargo-xwin`) and Wine are optional smoke paths, not prerequisites.
  GitHub Windows runners gate build, Rust tests and release artifacts but
  cannot replace interactive desktop checks. **Settled (user 2026-09-30):**
  Sandbox is enabled, installed, rebooted, then closed after a failed
  preflight (user-dismissed WM_CLOSE; no processes remain). Phase 1-3 live
  proof is physical-desktop owned windows first; Win+L policy
  experiments are deferred to Phase 4 Sandbox guest-only.

## Process, authority and lifecycle

Run one Rust executable in each user's interactive session, not a Windows
service. Services run in noninteractive Session 0, where they cannot manage
the user's window handles (HWNDs) [V: W1,W2].

- [I: W2,W3; `docs/decisions.md:50-58`] The executable hosts event listeners,
  `tiler-core`, window control, recovery state, tray and an on-demand settings
  window. Add a separate input thread only if interception tests require it.
  KWin's planner/script/effect/tray responsibilities need no matching Windows
  processes or D-Bus/JSON hop. Use `tiler-protocol` for external IPC only.
- [V: W4] User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) restricts lower-integrity
  processes from sending certain messages to higher-integrity processes.
  Integrity level (IL) is Windows' low/medium/high process trust level; an
  ordinary user app normally runs at medium IL. Test each window operation
  separately rather than treating UIPI as a blanket geometry ban.

| Concern | Proposed behavior and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Login | [V/I: W10,W11,W19] Choose a per-user logon-triggered scheduled task without elevation; compare delayed `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`, Startup folder and packaged MSIX startup. | Enable startup only by user choice. |
| Single instance / restart | Single instance *per session/user*, via named per-user mutex plus same-user ACL/lockfile; avoid global-name squatting. New CLI invocation talks to the running owner, or exits; never assumes an abandoned mutex restores windows [V: W10; I]. `RegisterApplicationRestart` does not guarantee unattended crash restart (runtime/consent conditions); compare scheduled task restart and a lightweight per-user launcher against the risk of restart loops. Always reconcile from current complete observations [V: W10; I]. |
| Lock, switch, RDP, sleep | `WTSRegisterSessionNotification`/`WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE`, `WM_POWERBROADCAST`, display topology/DPI messages; stop writes/overlays during lock, UAC secure desktop and inactive/RDP session, invalidate monitor handles, replay no setter, enumerate fresh and rebind on unlock/resume [V: W10,W14; I]. Detect Explorer `TaskbarCreated`, re-add tray and reconcile work areas [V: W13]. |
| Elevation and IPC | Stay medium integrity. UIPI/foreground constraints mean elevated, system, UAC and protected windows are an explicitly unmanaged class until per-operation geometry/hook proof; never auto-elevate or use UIAccess as an assumed workaround [V: W4,W15; I]. Same-user trust follows `docs/decisions.md:118-125`; if a CLI/updater/settings sidecar is needed, use a session-local named pipe with user-scoped security descriptor, owner identity and request bounds/correlation, no open network port. Do not use `WM_COPYDATA` across IL as the primary transport [V: W4; I]. |

## Window control and eligibility

Start with ordinary same-integrity windows. Every move needs a fresh native
readback: an API call returning success is not proof that the app accepted
the requested rectangle.

- [V: W2,W16-W18] `EnumWindows` and out-of-context `SetWinEventHook` observe
  creation, foreground, location and move/size lifecycle. The hook thread
  needs a message loop. Shell hooks supplement but do not replace complete
  enumeration; UI Automation can supply role/bounds for difficult apps.
- [I: W2] Coalesce our own move events, enumerate afresh after missed events,
  Explorer restarts and resume, and keep UI Automation off the hot path.
- [V: W2,W16] `SetWindowPos` and `DeferWindowPos` batch window moves, but do
  not acknowledge client acceptance. Use `SWP_NOACTIVATE|SWP_NOZORDER` for
  geometry, then read back and reconcile app-enforced minimum/maximum sizes.
  `SetForegroundWindow` can refuse a focus request.
- [V: W16] Set Per Monitor v2 dots-per-inch (DPI) awareness in the manifest.
  `GetWindowRect` includes invisible resize borders and can be DPI-virtualized;
  DWM's `DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS` gives visible bounds without DPI
  adjustment. Convert the desired visible rectangle to each app's outer
  window rectangle and remeasure after scale/output changes.
- [I: W4,W5,W16; `docs/decisions.md:551-583`] Classify owned dialogs,
  Universal Windows Platform (UWP) frames, cloaked, minimized, elevated and
  protected windows before tiling. Keep already-tiled fullscreen/maximized
  allocations, and do not classify an output-sized rectangle as fullscreen
  solely by its dimensions.

**Elevated windows [V: W4; I]:** an app launched with "Run as
administrator" runs at a higher integrity level than the ordinary tiler.
Examples include an administrator PowerShell/Terminal, Registry Editor,
Task Manager when elevated, installers and an administrator file manager.
The UAC confirmation screen itself is a separate secure desktop. If these
windows remain unmanaged, the user sees them float at their native position
without automatic tiling, group underlay or managed workspace hiding; other
normal windows continue tiling. A shortcut pressed while one is focused may
be observed, but its requested focus/geometry action may fail. Test each
operation rather than assuming UIPI blocks every call. User decision
2026-09-30: elevated apps stay unmanaged by default; a future user-chosen
option to run the tiler elevated may be considered.

## Shortcuts and host-setting conflicts

Many Win-key shortcuts can be overridden, but there are two distinct routes:
`RegisterHotKey` tries to register a chord, while `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` can suppress
the key event before it reaches ordinary consumers. `MOD_WIN` is documented as
reserved, so neither route guarantees a particular shell chord [V: W3].

- [V: W3; O: U11] AutoHotkey documents overriding native Win+E/Win+R.
  Bare `#key::` uses `RegisterHotKey` when possible; `#UseHook` or `$`
  explicitly selects its keyboard hook. Thus AutoHotkey bindings alone do
  **not** prove that `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` was used for Win+D, Win+Tab or Win+number.
- [V: W3; O: U11] A low-level hook runs on the installer's message-loop
  thread and may be silently removed after a timeout. AutoHotkey documents
  sending a harmless "menu mask key" before Win release to avoid opening
  Start. This is an implementation precedent, not a promise on our builds.
- [I: W3,U11] Offer configurable non-Win defaults first, with opt-in Win-key
  takeover where verified. Keep the hook fast and disabled in game mode.

Secure attention sequence (SAS) means Ctrl+Alt+Del's Winlogon-controlled
security path; an ordinary keyboard hook cannot replace it [V: W12].

| Chord | Documented / observed capability | Windows product position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Win+Arrow | [V: W3; O: U3] OS Snap shortcut; FancyZones has an explicit override. | Opt-in after measuring Snap coexistence. |
| Win+Shift+Arrow | [V: W12; O: U3] Left/Right move between monitors; Up/Down stretch or restore. FancyZones deliberately leaves the monitor-move chords intact. | Probe hook takeover per direction; different default. |
| Win+D | [V: W12; O: U11] OS Show Desktop; AutoHotkey supports overriding built-in Win hotkeys generally. A verified hook-based `#d::` result is still missing. | Observed-overridable class; test actual method and shell suppression. |
| Win+Tab | [V: W12; O: U11] OS Task View; AutoHotkey's documented generic Win-key override applies, but no per-chord hook guarantee was found. | Same: probe `#Tab::` with and without forced hook. |
| Win+1..9 | [V: W12; O: U11] OS taskbar activation; generic override precedent, not a verified `#1::` hook result. | Same: probe each digit and taskbar result. |
| Win+L | [V: W12; O: U12] Lock path persists despite ordinary AutoHotkey interception. A per-user policy disables locking, but whether a hook can then claim Win+L is unproven. | Explicit opt-in option and isolation spike below; default preserves locking. |
| Win+Z, Win+G, Ctrl+Alt+Del | [V: W3,W12] Snap layouts, Game Bar, secure attention respectively. | Avoid by default; do not promise SAS takeover. |
| Other user chords | [V: W3] `RegisterHotKey` reports collisions rather than transferring ownership. | Configurable non-Win default, e.g. `Alt+H/J/K/L` after conflict testing. |

**Win+Arrow is a first-class acceptance gate [user decision 2026-09-30]:**
the defaults remain non-Win, but this user depends on a reliable opt-in
override. The early physical test system spike must prove key-down/up delivery,
suppression of Snap/Start side effects, reversal when disabled, operation
with focus on normal windows and no game interference. Do not call the
Windows experience feature-complete for them until the override passes a
real Win11 session check. FancyZones proves an override exists in at least
one product, not that our hook, every direction or every Windows build works
[O: U3].

**Win+L policy choice.** Windows maps "Remove Lock Computer" to
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`, value
`DisableLockWorkstation=1` (DWORD). This is a *user-scoped* policy, not an
HKLM-wide administrator setting [V: W12]. Normal HKCU writes need no
elevation when the key's access control list allows `KEY_SET_VALUE`;
organizational policy can deny or overwrite the value [V: W30]. Windows
documents that enabling it prevents
workstation locking, including the Ctrl+Alt+Del Lock route [V: W12].

| Option | Consequence | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keep lock policy unset; bind focus-right elsewhere | [V: W12] Win+L remains a reliable user lock action. | Default. |
| User explicitly opts into Win+L; set policy to 1 only after snapshot/readback | [V: W12; O: U12] Policy prevents locking; community reports say the Ctrl+Alt+Del Lock entry disappears and `LockWorkStation()` may also fail. Neither freeing Win+L nor moving lock to another chord is established. | Offer only if a safely isolated, reversible experiment proves hook delivery, replacement lock and restore. |

The policy documentation does not specify whether a registry write takes
effect without logoff or whether `LockWorkStation()` still works. Community
reports differ on refresh timing and report that the API can fail while the
policy is set [O: U12]. Test the policy, both locking paths and hook delivery
before/after writing it. Revert by removing only our owned value (or restoring
the exact prior value), read back, and re-test actual locking. If a policy
controller overwrites it or the old state cannot be proved, leave it alone
and show the conflict. This is closer to KDE's explicit Fix/Revert than a
silent shortcut reassignment, but carries a broader loss of lock access
[I: `docs/decisions.md:96-117,749-836`].

[I: W3,U11; `docs/decisions.md:96-117`] Test AutoHotkey-style menu masking,
key-down/up and Start behavior without logging raw keystrokes. Snap Assist
and layouts can compete with dragging as well as hotkeys; settings should
show current conflicts and explicit Fix/Revert, never change global Snap at
install/startup. Preserve a preimage for any setting we actually change;
uninstall restores only an unchanged project-owned override. Keep elevated
foreground windows unmanaged until hook, geometry and focus are tested
separately [I: W4].

## Dynamic workspace choice

Native Windows virtual desktops cannot supply independent workspaces on two
monitors through the documented API. A managed visibility layer is the
candidate, contingent on crash and task-switcher behavior.

| Approach | Capability / shell cost | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native virtual desktops | Public `IVirtualDesktopManager` only Get ID, Is current, Move HWND to *known* desktop GUID; no create/list/select/remove, and native selection is global, not independently per monitor [V: W5; I]. Task View/taskbar and crash restoration stay Windows-owned [I]. | Interoperate with native desktop *current-visible* windows; no native-only parity claim. |
| `IVirtualDesktopManagerInternal`, VirtualDesktopAccessor, `winvd` | Undocumented COM interfaces/IIDs and method signatures have changed across builds; VirtualDesktopAccessor documents build-specific support, wrappers cannot make a private ABI stable [O: U6]. | Do not build release workspace authority on them. Could benchmark in throwaway spike only. |
| Project-managed, own logical `(monitor,workspace)` domains | Supports per-output-local/global-unique/shared, numbered trailing empty and background plans using existing core domains [O: `crates/tiler-core/src/session/world.rs:31-75`; I]. Visibility and focus/recovery become our responsibility; Alt+Tab/taskbar/Task View are not defined as a third-party workspace protocol [V: W6; I]. | Preferred target if a reversible visibility strategy passes gate; otherwise pause full workspace release rather than silently remove first-class behavior. |

**Visibility mechanics:** a hidden window is not a minimized window.

- [V: W6; O: U1,U2,U4] `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE/SW_SHOWNA)` is public, but may
  affect taskbar/Alt+Tab or be reversed by the app. Minimize changes the app's
  state; offscreen parking leaves a window mapped. komorebi uses private
  `IApplicationView::SetCloak` for foreign windows. The documented
  `DWMWA_CLOAK` setter has no documented cross-process authority; an external
  repro reports `E_ACCESSDENIED`.
- [I: W6] Prototype `ShowWindow` first, comparing other methods only to learn
  their shell behavior. A switch hides the owned inactive set, reveals the
  target without activation, observes focus and reconciles. Explicit quit,
  update and uninstall restore only project-hidden windows.
- [I] Before hiding, atomically record the owner, version and bounded window
  identities. On restart, verify process/session identity before revealing:
  an HWND can be reused. Keep a recovery command and visible failure status.
  No process can re-show windows after a crash until something relaunches it.
- [I] Gate adoption on two-monitor switching, taskbar/Alt+Tab/Task View,
  accessibility, fullscreen, pinned windows and forced-process-loss tests.

## Border, underlay and drop preview

Z-order insertion is a candidate for a real group underlay, not a proven
solution. Test a non-topmost layered window immediately **behind** the
group's lowest member and its behavior in Task View before selecting it.

| Surface | Option and limitation | Recommended order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active border | `DWMWA_BORDER_COLOR` Win11 build 22000+ is native but fixed by system frame geometry/thickness and foreign-HWND setter behavior must be probed; restore `DWMWA_COLOR_DEFAULT` on release [V: W6; I]. GlazeWM uses this attribute [O: U2]. | Spike first, adopt only if visibility/ownership and exact restore pass; configurable gap/width/radius needs own overlay [I]. |
| Configurable active outline / drag fill | [V: W6,W16; O: U1,U3] Own layered click-through `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW|WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` window; PowerToys uses per-monitor preview windows and komorebi uses separate border windows. | Place active outline above its target but below owned dialogs when possible; preview exists only during drag. Test focus/input and stacking. |
| Group **underlay** | [V: W2,W31; I] `SetWindowPos(underlay, lowest_member, ..., SWP_NOACTIVATE|SWP_NOMOVE|SWP_NOSIZE|SWP_NOOWNERZORDER)` inserts the underlay *after* (behind) that member in Z order. If group members occupy a contiguous non-topmost block, it is behind them and above lower non-group windows. | Leading candidate. Recheck membership and Z order on foreground/reorder events; measure lag, topmost and modal failure modes. |
| Per-window child / DirectComposition | Child of a foreign HWND, compositor injection or reparenting changes app ownership/input and is outside supported first path; DirectComposition can improve owned-layer rendering but adds complexity [V: W6; I]. | Do not use to bypass window-manager boundary. |

### Shell visibility and custom drawing

Tool-window styles should keep the underlay out of Alt+Tab and the taskbar.
No public API found guarantees that an overlay cannot appear in Task View or
in a *different window's thumbnail*. Test that in the actual Win11 shell.

| Route | Established behavior and limitation | Experiment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unowned top-level `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW|WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` | [V: W34] `TOOLWINDOW` excludes the taskbar and Alt+Tab; `NOACTIVATE` avoids focus and also omits a taskbar button by default. `WS_EX_APPWINDOW` would force one; do not set it. Task View and Win+Tab thumbnail behavior are undocumented for this combination. | Create a non-topmost, click-through layered underlay. Verify no separate taskbar, Alt+Tab or Task View entry, no target-window thumbnail contamination and no keyboard focus. |
| Overlay owned by our hidden host | [V: W34] A hidden owner is a documented alternative to suppress a taskbar button. Owned windows have owner-relative Z-order constraints [V: W2]. Ownership by a group member belonging to another process is not the same as our own hidden owner. | Compare with the unowned tool window for dialog stacking, Task View and desktop switching. Do not assume ownership improves underlay Z order. |
| DirectComposition / `Windows.UI.Composition` visuals | [V: W35] DirectComposition binds a visual tree only to an HWND owned by the caller; foreign HWND returns `DCOMPOSITION_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`. WinRT Composition examples create `DesktopWindowTarget` for the app's HWND. Better painting within our own surface, not permission to paint beneath foreign apps without a host window. | Animate multiple visuals within one owned window; compare latency and Task View behavior with a layered bitmap. |
| `DwmRegisterThumbnail` | [V: W36] Copies a top-level source window image into our top-level destination, or into the desktop window. The desktop exception avoids our own HWND but stays behind ordinary windows; it cannot place custom group color between arbitrary apps. | No underlay prototype; relevant only if a separate thumbnail preview is chosen later. |
| Magnification API | [V: W37] A magnifier control redraws sampled screen content inside a layered *host window*. It is for magnification, not injecting colored group geometry into DWM. | Reject for underlay; adds capture/composition and cannot remove the host HWND. |
| One monitor-sized transparent surface | [V: W34; I] One owned layered top-level HWND per monitor can draw active ring, filled group region and drop preview together. It reduces window count, not shell visibility or Z-order conflicts: one Z plane cannot simultaneously draw a ring above a group and an underlay beneath it. | Compare one surface with per-visual windows; test click-through, repaint cost, topmost dialogs, fullscreen, Task View and mixed-DPI monitors. Split underlay and ring into two planes if needed. |

[O: U1,U2,U3,W38] komorebi creates border HWNDs with `TOOLWINDOW`,
`NOACTIVATE` and initial `TOPMOST` styles; GlazeWM's Windows 11 focus border
uses `DWMWA_BORDER_COLOR` on the target app instead of a border HWND;
FancyZones creates unowned `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` zone windows per work area,
shows them only while needed with `SW_SHOWNA`, then hides/pools them. Those
choices explain their taskbar/Alt+Tab approach, **not** proven Task View
absence for a persistent underlay.

[I: W34-W38] Throwaway experiment: owned Notepad-like test windows, one
then two monitors. Compare unowned and own-host-owned tool overlays, one
full-monitor surface and per-visual HWNDs while opening/closing Task View
(Win+Tab), cycling Alt+Tab, switching native virtual desktops and launching
Explorer's Snap/Task View animations. Record separate overlay entries,
thumbnails, visual bleed/flash, focus, Z order, CPU and teardown. Test whether
`IVirtualDesktopManager::IsWindowOnCurrentVirtualDesktop` reports the overlay
as expected on each switch [V: W5]. No public Task View enter/leave callback
has been established, so do not build correctness on one; compare hiding on
observed focus/desktop change against leaving a passive overlay visible.
Repeat after Explorer restart and with a fullscreen game. If underlay
placement or Task View is unacceptable, use the user-approved outline.
Cross-process composition attachment, foreign-window reparenting, Explorer
injection and undocumented shell APIs are excluded [V: W35; I].

**Z-order failure cases:** placement is only as stable as the current stack.

- [V: W2,W31] Topmost windows stay above normal windows; owned popups must
  stay above their owner. `GetWindow(GW_HWNDNEXT)` can inspect what is below
  a group member, but Microsoft warns against an unbounded walk when HWNDs
  disappear mid-enumeration.
- [O: U1,U13] komorebi supports multiple border Z-order modes and repositions
  borders on events. A popup-overdraw report shows the cost of permanently
  topmost borders.
- [I] Bound and validate the walk, find the lowest eligible group member,
  insert the underlay beneath it and verify the resulting order. Recheck on
  foreground, reorder, show/hide and drag; skip redundant moves. Foreign
  windows can interleave members. Suppress the underlay if mixed topmost/
  owned members or occlusion prevent a correct view; never reorder apps to
  make the underlay visible. Place the active ring *above its target* and
  below its owned dialog when possible, rather than at the group's bottom.

**Game gate:** hide visuals and stop tiling writes while a game owns the
monitor. Measure residual work rather than assuming zero overhead.

- [V: W22] `SHQueryUserNotificationState` distinguishes exclusive Direct3D
  fullscreen from broader busy/presentation states, but it is a notification
  hint and sends no fullscreen-start event.
- [I: W3,W22] Cross-check foreground, monitor bounds and exclusions; test
  exclusive, borderless and fullscreen-optimized games plus Game Bar and
  anti-cheat. Measure input latency, frame time, CPU and geometry calls;
  disable hooks/overlays if their residual impact is measurable.

## UI, language and native feel

Users will notice a tiler that repaints unaffected apps, leaves a border
over dialogs or steals focus more than one that lacks animated moves. Favor
exact geometry and quiet, event-driven visuals.

- [V: W23,W24; I] `windows-rs` exposes Win32, DWM and Component Object Model
  (COM) APIs to Rust. Start with Rust for the tiler, Win32 tray and settings.
  WinUI 3 offers Fluent/Mica but adds Windows App SDK integration; WPF would
  require a C#/.NET settings process. Use either for a measured control or
  accessibility gap, not as a prerequisite for tiling.
- [V: W13,W25,W26; I] `winit` provides a window loop, not native controls;
  `egui` is non-native in appearance and needs Narrator/contrast checks.
  Slint has attribution/commercial licensing choices. Audit `tray-icon` for
  Explorer restart, menu keyboard use and notification icon version 4;
  `Shell_NotifyIcon` directly is another small Rust integration path.
- [V: W6,W13,W26; I] Use a keyboard-accessible notification-area menu and
  re-add its icon on Explorer's `TaskbarCreated`. Settings should follow
  Windows 11 spacing, system accent and optional Mica backdrop, with dark,
  light, contrast and reduced-motion support. Display confirmed state, not
  merely queued commands. Localize labels later; retain stable action IDs.

**Observed sources of jank:**

- [O: U14] komorebi users reported JetBrains IDEs flickering on *other*
  windows' events. Its `54c58be` fix compares both window and border
  rectangles before calling `SetWindowPos`. Skip no-op setters and measure
  repaint behavior across apps, not just the focused window.
- [O: U13,U14] A GlazeWM 3.10.1 report describes the same JetBrains symptom;
  no-op `SetWindowPos` is the reporter's hypothesis, not a proven GlazeWM
  cause. GlazeWM also merged a delayed border-color reapply for flicker.
  komorebi reported borders painted over Save dialogs and border lag with
  animation enabled. These are concrete focus/visual defects, not evidence
  that Windows itself animates every move.
- [O: U15] A komorebi user reported a Firefox title update pulling focus
  back to its monitor. A GlazeWM user reported workspace switches when an
  inactive Files window took focus after a download; their proposed fix was
  still an open PR. Do not switch workspace merely because a hidden app
  emits a foreground-like event. Check actual foreground and user intent.
- [I: W2,U13,U14] Test focus changes, window creation, resizing, native
  dialogs and optional animations for flicker, lag, redraw and unintended
  activation. `SWP_NOACTIVATE` prevents our overlay move from activating it;
  it cannot prevent another app or the shell from restacking windows.

**Windows move animations [V: W2,W6,W32]:** plain `SetWindowPos` specifies
geometry, not an animation curve. `AnimateWindow` is a separate API, while
Snap/minimize/maximize can have shell/DWM transitions. The per-HWND
`DWMWA_TRANSITIONS_FORCEDISABLED` attribute takes a BOOL: TRUE disables DWM
transitions and FALSE enables them. Documentation does not show that ordinary
`SetWindowPos` moves animate, that this attribute stops Snap, or that it
can safely be set on a foreign app's HWND. Do not blanket-disable it.
Compare video and readbacks on an owned window, then test foreign-HWND
permission and exact restoration before considering an opt-in override.
If the previous value cannot be read, do not change a foreign HWND [I].

## Packaging, signing, updates and observability

**Store is an option.** Pursue the obvious set for Windows users: a Microsoft
Store listing, a signed per-user installer on GitHub Releases and a `winget`
manifest for that installer. Store MSIX is preferable *if* desktop hooks,
login startup, workspace recovery and update/revert survive packaging proof.
Otherwise the Store can list the same signed MSI/EXE, with our updater rather
than Store-managed updates [I: W19,W20,W39-W42]. No second running owner.

| Path | Fit | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Store MSIX (preferred test) | [V: W19,W20,W39,W40,W46] Package a classic desktop app with `runFullTrust` (restricted capability requiring Store approval), `packagedClassicApp` and `mediumIL`, not a sandboxed UWP controller. User-controlled `windows.startupTask` supports login. Store signs/hosts MSIX at no cert charge and delivers updates. The package is per-user and has different storage/lifecycle behavior. | Prove window hooks, startup, registry/settings, restore on update/uninstall, capability approval, policy compliance and no side-by-side owner. Store updates only; do not run Velopack in this channel. |
| Store listing of MSI/EXE | [V: W39,W41] Store accepts a publisher-hosted, offline, silent, signed installer at an immutable versioned HTTPS URL. The installer **and all PE binaries** need a CA-trusted Authenticode signature; a self-signed certificate does not qualify. Store does not update existing installations. | Fallback Store route if MSIX proof fails; use the same signed installer and explicit updater as GitHub. |
| Signed direct installer + winget | [V: W20,W28; O: W42] Standard per-user WiX MSI or Inno EXE downloadable from GitHub; `winget` adds a command-line discovery/upgrade route. PowerToys documents Store, GitHub and `winget` together. | Ship the same publisher identity across channels; ensure install/update cannot create duplicate tiler owners. |
| Portable zip | [I] Manual launch with no guaranteed login/startup, update or uninstall revert. | Development/trial route only, with standalone restore/stop CLI. |

**Channel costs [V: W20,W39-W42]:** Store MSIX provides Microsoft signing,
hosting and updates without a signing-certificate purchase; Partner Center
developer registration is listed as free, but packaging and certification
still cost development time. Direct GitHub installers and Store-listed
MSI/EXE need a CA-trusted signer for the publisher path: Azure Artifact
Signing starts near US$9.99/month for eligible identities; an OV certificate
is roughly US$150-300/year plus hardware key storage. The Store-listed
MSI/EXE also needs publisher-hosted versioned binaries. `winget` adds a
manifest, not a second signing service, and uses the signed installer;
GitHub release hosting is separate from Store hosting. Actual eligibility
and ongoing delivery cost remain to be checked before publication [I].

**Store technical boundary:** a Win32 Store listing is possible, but
certification of this tiler's input and settings behavior remains unproven.

- [V: W3,W43] `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` is a user-session hook with callbacks on its
  own thread, not DLL injection into other apps. Microsoft documents hook
  delivery involving packaged Store apps, not certification of our override.
- [V: W46] A medium-integrity MSIX desktop app declares restricted
  `runFullTrust` and explains it for Store approval. The separate restricted
  `inputObservation`/`inputSuppression` capabilities refer to partner-only
  input APIs; they are not a substitute for a Win32 low-level hook.
- [V: W40] Packaged AppData and registry redirection depend on runtime
  behavior. A medium-integrity classic desktop process is distinct from an
  AppContainer process; packaging still needs a settings/recovery test.
- [V: W44] The effective Store policy is version 7.19 (since 2025-10-14).
  It requires supported methods and consent for changing Windows settings
  and forbids disabling platform safety features. Version 7.20 has been
  published but takes effect only on 2026-10-22.
- [I: W19,W39-W44] Prove packaged Win+Arrow hook behavior, user-enabled
  startup task and independent recovery. The Win+L lock-disabling policy
  might block Store acceptance even if the user opts in; do not promise it
  in the Store build. MSI/EXE login startup also requires separate consent.
- [O: W42,W45] PowerToys with FancyZones is in the Store and also offers
  GitHub and `winget`; FancyWM and an AutoHotkey v2 Store Edition have
  listings. This proves distribution precedents, not approval of our hook,
  Win+L policy or managed workspaces.

[V: W27] Velopack has a Rust client and HTTP update/packaging flow. Its
`vpk` CLI needs .NET SDK 8 on the Windows release runner, not the NixOS dev
shell. [I] Test update with a running owner, hidden-window restore, rollback
and signing order before choosing it for the installer channel. Do not run
two auto-updaters against one installation: Store MSIX uses Store updates,
Store-listed MSI/EXE and GitHub installers use the chosen app/installer update
path, and `winget upgrade` remains user-invoked. Scoop/Chocolatey can be
community-maintained alternatives [V: W28]. Keep Windows CI independent of
Nix/KDE delivery. Pin tools, record hashes and signing identity, and compare
unsigned payloads separately from timestamped signed packages [I].

[V: W20] Azure Artifact Signing (formerly Trusted Signing) costs about
US$9.99/month at the basic tier and limits individual eligibility by region.
Organization-validated certificates run roughly US$150-300/year plus hardware
key storage; extended validation costs more and no longer immediately clears
SmartScreen. Microsoft signs Store-submitted MSIX packages, but a direct
download of the same MSIX still needs its own trusted signature [V: W20].
[I] Check the owner's signing eligibility before purchasing; keep publisher
identity stable across EXE, installer and update metadata.

[I: `docs/principles.md:50-66`, W29] Write bounded structured `tracing`
summaries under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\plasma-auto-tiler\logs`; enable redacted
event detail with `trace`. Correlate command, observation, setter, readback
and recovery; distinguish dispatch, acceptance, application and uncertainty.
Exclude titles, app content, raw HWND/process IDs, executable paths and
payloads from ordinary logs. Logging failure must not stop tiling. Event
Tracing for Windows (ETW) can later support performance diagnosis; Event Log
provider registration adds installation work. Use no code injection, kernel
driver, network listener, raw keystroke log or elevated helper by default;
scope any named pipe to the same user [V: W4].

## Upstream lessons and licensing

Upstream projects demonstrate practical techniques and failure modes, not
Windows guarantees. Their checked licenses constrain code reuse.

| Project | Evidence and transferable lesson | License / reuse |
| --- | --- | --- |
| komorebi (Rust) | [O: U1,U13,U14] `komorebi/src/window.rs` supports hide/minimize/private cloak and recovery; `komorebi/src/border_manager/mod.rs` defines top/non-topmost/bottom modes, while `border.rs` follows location changes. Its flicker and popup issues are instructive. | [V: U1,U6] Komorebi License 2.0.0 restricts derivative redistribution. Study only; independently licensed MIT `VirtualDesktopAccessor` code needs separate provenance. |
| GlazeWM (Rust) | `packages/wm-platform/src/native_window.rs` calls DWM border color; workspace/overlay methods expose Win11 1px limits and hide tradeoffs [U2]. | GPL-3.0 project: study, do not copy into a differently licensed binary without a deliberate license decision [U2]. |
| PowerToys FancyZones | WinEvent-backed per-monitor zone overlay and explicit Snap override; not automatic split-tree authority [U3]. | MIT, reuse possible with notice and independent fit assessment [U3]. |
| Whim | MIT C# plugin/workspace architecture; README explicitly avoids native desktops for per-monitor workspaces [U4]. | MIT, conceptual/data reuse with notice; not a Rust engine drop-in [U4]. |
| workspacer | MIT C# workspace/window filters and hide behavior [U5]. | MIT, reuse possible with notice; hide/reveal is not Windows virtual-desktop parity [U5]. |
| bug.n | AutoHotkey tiler/bar and shortcut patterns [U9]. | GPL-3.0, study only absent license change [U9]. |
| Seelen UI | Rust/Tauri custom desktop UI and workspace behavior; a larger replacement-shell direction than this tiler [U10]. | AGPL-3.0, study only absent license change [U10]. |

[I: W23,W25,U7] Check this repository's outbound license and the exact
third-party revision before reusing any code. `windows-rs`, `winit` and
`tray-icon` are candidates, not selected dependencies.

## Recommended architecture at a glance

One non-elevated Rust process owns desktop control. Native Windows APIs are
called in its adapter; no KWin processes or effect library are transplanted.

- [I] **Processes:** tiler, observer, actuator, visuals, tray and settings
  window share one user-session process. An installer/updater runs separately
  only while replacing binaries; an optional CLI uses a same-user named pipe.
- [I] **Crates:** retain `tiler-core` as layout authority. Use
  `tiler-protocol` only for external versioned messages. A proposed
  `tiler-windows` crate/binary owns Windows events, physical pixels, window
  visibility, input and shell lifecycle. Follow the
  [extraction audit](../cross-platform-core/extraction.md) for shared policy.
- [I] **Languages/dependencies:** Rust and `windows`/`windows-sys`, with
  `tracing`; evaluate `tray-icon` and Velopack behind their proof gates.
  C#/C++ is a contingency for a demonstrated settings/accessibility gap.
  Build Windows 11 x64 with the MSVC toolchain first.

## Phased roadmap (qualitative)

**KDE-first core extraction is Phase 0 [user decision 2026-09-30].** Windows
development starts only after its KWin fixtures and applicable user live
checks pass. Then use disposable owned apps on the physical Windows 11 test system;
make restore/stop work before hiding an ordinary desktop window.

| Phase | Goal / scope | Exit evidence | Throwaway spikes first | Effort / risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0. KDE-first extraction | Move only proven portable policy; preserve current KWin behavior before Windows implementation. | KWin fixtures and user live checks for each extraction step, as specified in [extraction](../cross-platform-core/extraction.md); no Windows product build. | KWin pure-policy fixtures before edits; no Windows host mutation. | Medium / controlled KWin regression risk. |
| 1. Physical host + input/recovery | Install Windows toolchain, record single-display baseline (this test system), prove independent restore command and Win+Arrow. | Native build, dev restart/log loop and verified kill/restore on owned windows. **Win+Arrow opt-in works on the user's physical Win11 test system** with Snap/Start suppression and reversal; otherwise user-specific feature completeness is blocked. | `RegisterHotKey` vs `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` all four Win+Arrows, key-up masking, game disable; forced-crash restore on owned windows. Win+L policy is deferred to Phase 4 Sandbox guest-only. | Medium / highest input risk. |
| 2. Window geometry | Wire Windows observation/actuation to the extracted Engine for normal windows; retain evidence-based convergence. | Owned apps then representative desktop apps tile/read back with DPI, focus, sleep, display change and Explorer restart; no game writes. | WinEvent dropped-event, DWM invisible-frame/min-size and UWP/owned-dialog probes; hook timeout detection. | Large / high. |
| 3. Required workspaces + visuals | After visibility proof, implement per-monitor logical workspaces, borders, group visual and drop preview. | Two monitors with independent workspaces (other Win11 test system), trailing empty, taskbar/Alt+Tab/Task View accepted, crash recovery and gaming pass. True underlay **or approved outline fallback** works without shell pollution. | `ShowWindow` hide/reveal ledger and forced loss; underlay inserted behind group; owned/unowned tool HWND vs single custom-drawn monitor surface through Win+Tab, desktop switch, Explorer animation and fullscreen; private cloak only comparative. | Large / highest recovery and rendering risk. |
| 4. Settings + distribution | Live apply, consented conflict/revert, tray, Store proof, signed manual install and updates. | Store package feasibility or documented installer-listing fallback; `winget` manifest, signed GitHub release, clean install/update/uninstall and owner restoration; user accessibility journey. **Win+Arrow remains a feature-complete exit gate.** | Packaged full-trust hook/startup/install test; Store certification preflight; Win32/tray UI; MSIX vs signed MSI/EXE updater channel; signing identity and SmartScreen. | Medium-large / high. |

[I: W9] Test portable Rust behavior on Linux and Windows and headless
contracts on hosted CI. Run owner-verified interactive journeys on the user's
physical test system with project restore available, then physical/manual game, UAC,
fast-user-switch, sleep and remote-desktop checks. A VM is optional for
isolation, not assumed available. Hosted CI passing cannot prove hooks,
fullscreen or anti-cheat compatibility.

## Open user decisions

Windows 11 x64, managed-workspace release bar, shortcut defaults and
Win+Arrow gate, explicit Win+L opt-in, group-outline fallback, KDE-first
sequencing, physical test system development and unsurprising distribution are user
decisions of 2026-09-30. The technology behind them still needs proof.

| Status / decision | Options and consequences | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decided: OS and workspaces | [User 2026-09-30] Win11 x64; managed per-monitor workspaces before Windows or macOS feature-complete. | Tiling-only previews can precede the workspace gate. |
| Decided: shortcuts | [User 2026-09-30] Non-Win defaults, proven opt-in Win+Arrow, explicit opt-in Win+L. Win+Arrow is required for this user's feature-complete experience. | Keep Win+L policy behavior as an unproven spike, not a promise. |
| Decided: group visual | [User 2026-09-30] Test custom drawing and shell pollution; outline fallback accepted if the underlay fails. | Choose a renderer only after Task View/Alt+Tab evidence. |
| Decided: development and distribution goal | [User 2026-09-30] Native physical Windows test system after KDE-first extraction; distribution should feel obvious. | Test Store MSIX alongside signed installer and winget, without promising MSIX certification. |
| Decided: elevated apps | [User 2026-09-30] Administrator apps stay unmanaged (floating) by default. | A future opt-in to run the tiler elevated may be considered; no UIAccess or elevated helper now. |
| Decided: workspace model | [User 2026-09-30] KDE-first extraction stops before the logical workspace model. | Refine the core workspace shape during Windows visibility spikes, then extract with matching KWin fixtures. |
| Open: Store implementation if both pass | [V: W39-W41; I] Store MSIX has Store signing/updates but differs in process/storage behavior; Store-listed MSI/EXE shares the manual installer and updater, but needs publisher signing and hosting. | Prefer MSIX only if desktop hooks, login, policy and recovery pass; otherwise list the signed installer. Resolve any user-visible updater/channel tradeoff with the user. |

The KDE-first logical workspace extraction choice is open in
[cross-platform extraction](../cross-platform-core/extraction.md); its shape
depends on Windows visibility evidence.

## Risks

The leading threats are unrecoverable hidden windows and any impact on games;
policy-based Win+L and overlay stacking add separate UX risks.

| Risk | Severity / trigger | Containment and proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inactive windows stranded after crash | Critical; managed hide/reveal fails | Owner-tagged recovery ledger, startup restore before normal operation, forced-kill/uninstall smoke; if unsafe, no managed-workspace release [I]. |
| Game latency/anti-cheat or fullscreen overlay | Critical; hook or HWND overlap on game | Physically measured exclusive/borderless/anti-cheat matrix, immediate event-gated disable, no overlay/writes while game active [V: W3,W22; I]. |
| Private COM API churn | High; internal desktops/shell cloak changes | Avoid as required path; build matrix only for comparison [O: U1,U6]. |
| Lost shortcuts / Start/Snap interference | High; Win chords conflict or silent LL removal | Non-Win defaults; hook matrix and recovery; explicit Fix/Revert with settings preimage [V: W3; I]. |
| Win+Arrow override fails or hurts games | Critical for this user's feature-complete goal | Physical test system hook/Snap/Start/game matrix before claiming support; non-Win defaults and immediate revert remain usable for previews [O: U3; I]. |
| Lock action disabled by Win+L policy | Critical; no remaining keyboard/API lock route | Deferred to Phase 4 guest-only Sandbox experiment; prove alternate lock, refresh timing, policy owner and exact revert there [V: W12; O: U12; I]. |
| Underlay pollutes Task View or covers dialogs | High; shell includes overlay, topmost or non-contiguous members | Compare unowned/owned tool windows and custom-drawn per-monitor surface during Win+Tab and desktop switches; suppress failed visual and use approved outline fallback [V: W34,W35; O: U13; I]. |
| Daily test system recovery fails | Critical; hide/restart/shortcut loop strands desktop | Independent restore command and out-of-hook kill switch verified before real windows; disable startup for crash probes [I]. |
| Store package lacks control or certification | High; hook/startup/Win+L policy refused | MSIX full-trust/startup/certification experiment, same signed MSI/EXE Store-listing fallback, channel-specific updates [V: W39-W44; I]. |
| DPI/client refusal/UWP/mixed IL | High; geometry/readback mismatch | Per-monitor-v2, physical frame conversion, complete observation, explicit skip with reason, app matrix [V: W4,W16; I]. |
| Explorer, sleep, RDP, fast-user switching | High; stale handles/work area | WTS/power/display/taskbar signals, fresh enumeration and controlled rebind, interactive VM/physical journey [V: W10,W13; I]. |
| Signing/update trust and supply chain | Medium-high; broken updater or SmartScreen | Locked CI, signed package and metadata, staged update rollback/recovery, channel separation [V: W20,W27; I]. |
