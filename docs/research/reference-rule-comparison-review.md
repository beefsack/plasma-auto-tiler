# Reference-rule comparison review

Scope: the 87 "comparisons requiring user review" entries from nine
source-fill notes, grouped by rule, tallied across all 12 reference
columns per semantic leg. Recommendations require user selection; approved
rules and the reference matrix remain authoritative.

Legend: C COSMIC, H Hyprland, B bspwm, I i3, X xmonad, S sway,
Q qtile, A awesome, N niri, P PaperWM, K karousel, R paneru.
Non-scrolling = C,H,B,I,X,S,Q,A. Votes: A agree, D differ,
U unsupported (no counterpart; never a vote), T TBD (applicable but
untraced; never a vote). Partial-TBD legs vote only the evidenced leg.
Scrolling N/P/K/R is reported separately from non-scrolling references.

Policy applied: a NORMATIVE requirement alone is not a recorded
deliberate deviation; only explicit intentional exclusion/deferral,
documented platform policy, or rationale addressing that reference
difference settles an entry. Uncovered COSMIC differences are MATERIAL
even as single outliers (no setting follows). A clear non-scrolling
majority difference is MATERIAL even when COSMIC agrees; settings only
for meaningful coherent alternatives, except single-outlier or scrolling-only
differences.
COSMIC is the default recommendation absent stronger documented user
intent. The user decides; nothing here selects behavior.

## MATERIAL (impact order)

### G-01. Equal-sentinel and full-zero guards (REQ-SPC-04a D1)

Rule: [REQ-SPC-04a](../spec/functional-spec.md) (:349),
[fixed-size D1](../decisions.md) (:425-435). Current: whole-vector
guards reject full-zero and unbounded sentinels; equal partial-zero
counts as fixed. D1 calls its default COSMIC without acknowledging any
deviation; the 8/8 non-scrolling contrary evidence below materially
undercuts that claimed parity.

- Sentinel leg (min=max=INT_MAX): D10 C,H,B,I,X,S,Q,A,N,K
  (all float raw equality; K verified both backends,
  `S-kar-spc`); A1 P (tiles everything, no fixed branch); U1 R
  (role-gated, no hint counterpart); T0. Total 1+10+1+0 = 12.
- Full-zero leg (min=max=(0,0)): A8 H,I,S,Q,A,N,P,K (tiles);
  D2 B,X (floats); T1 C (Wayland tiles, X11 present-zero floats);
  U1 R. Total 8+2+1+1 = 12. COSMIC's X11 disagreement is another
  uncovered guard difference, not dismissed as an ordinary single outlier;
  the other seven non-scrolling profiles split A5/D2 in favor of our guard.
- Host semantics: the KWin sentinel is an unbounded marker
  (no-maximum), not an explicit positive equal size; the scenario
  labels it cross-platform raw-equal, so each ref floats it while
  Ours normalizes it to non-fixed. Genuine fixed windows keep no-touch
  admission (D8), so floating is the low-write path and tiling is the
  write path.
- Options: (a) keep D1 rejection (stands against 8/8 + COSMIC;
  sentinel windows receive tiled allocations with writes; genuine fixed
  no-touch untouched); (b) follow majority/COSMIC (float sentinels,
  retaining their native frames without tiling writes); (c) adapter
  normalizes the KWin unbounded marker before core while preserving
  genuine fixed-size no-touch (host adaptation, needs design).
- Recommendation: retain normalization for genuine host-unbounded markers
  and full-zero bounds, explicitly documenting the host adaptation rather
  than claiming exact COSMIC parity. Confirm that choice against the ten
  sentinel-float references before implementation; it must not normalize away
  genuinely fixed positive hints. Option (c) makes the host/core boundary
  explicit but needs design; option (b) follows raw equality instead.

### G-02. Disconnect/return vs approved displacement (REQ-OUT-06)

Rule: [REQ-OUT-06](../spec/functional-spec.md) (:282),
[displacement](../decisions.md) (:183-207). Current: preserve-aside
(never merge), show relocated R workspace with its active focus,
nearest survivor (primary/order fallback), automatic origin return,
moved IDs lose auto-return. Ours native journey TBD both platforms.

- Shown leg: A1 I (shows moved focused workspace); D6 C (L keeps
  showing + L-MRU fixup), X (keeps current positional), Q (hides,
  L keeps showing), A (evacuates to first tag), B (retains in place,
  no evacuation), N (keeps L showing; affinity agrees separately);
  U1 K (single-screen); T4 H,S,P,R (shown node unrecorded/host).
  Total 1+6+1+4 = 12.
- Destination leg: D4 C,H,I,S (first-remaining / primary-first /
  priority-order, not nearest); U5 X,Q,A,B,K (no output-destination
  choice: positional / hide / tag-granularity / retain / single-screen);
  T3 N (sole-survivor fixture undiscriminating), P,R (host).
  Total 0+4+5+3 = 12.
- Affinity leg: A5 C,H,N,S,B (return/priority affinity; B same-RandR
  reuse); D4 I,Q,A,X (fresh/positional assignment); U1 K; T2 P,R.
  Total 5+4+1+2 = 12.
- Uncovered COSMIC shown + destination differences; no coherent
  alternative (retain vs merge vs hide vs fresh-assign).
- Options: (a) keep nearest + relocated-show + affinity; (b-e) any
  single ref model; (f) no setting.
- Recommendation: keep (a) under the documented displacement policy
  (stronger intent than the COSMIC default): merging destroys
  displaced layouts; retain-in-place strands workspaces; fresh
  assignment loses return affinity. Consequence: stands against COSMIC
  shown-L and 6 shown-leg differers; nearest-vs-first-remaining and
  the native journey are unproven live.

### G-03. Sole-window next send fills pre-transfer E, COSMIC avoids it (REQ-WS-14)

Rule: [REQ-WS-14](../spec/functional-spec.md) (:167), item 2.2
([workspaces](../decisions.md) :275-279). Current: scoped ordinal ring,
resolve once, filling trailing E pulls next spare from normal
lifecycle, follow default + stay alternative.

- Sole-next leg ([R-WS-20](../spec/reference-outcomes/workspaces.md)):
  Ours fills pre-transfer E. COSMIC avoids E on every inferred chord
  (Left/Right early return; Up/Down `InvalidWorkspaceIndex`; exact
  next-leg outcome TBD but the avoid-E policy is sourced,
  `S-cos-wssingle`; pin status of the invoked chord is F, which does
  not erase the policy leg). A6 B,I,S,N,P,K (fill E; P conditional on
  E existing in GNOME's scope); D2 C,R (R: both legs no-moves);
  T1 H (numeric+1 may be E or a newly created workspace);
  U3 X,Q,A (no relative-send verb). Total 6+2+3+1 = 12.
- Options: (a) keep ring fill (stands against COSMIC alone on this
  leg); (b) follow COSMIC chord-branching.
- Recommendation: keep (a): item 2.2 NORMATIVE explicitly selects
  "sending into it fills it," which is stronger documented intent
  than the COSMIC default. Consequence: Up/Down-inferred single-window
  sends fill E where COSMIC refuses; exact COSMIC next-leg outcome
  stays TBD (chord F), recorded honestly.

### G-04. History retention vs invalidation (REQ-WS-08/12i)

Rule: [REQ-WS-08](../spec/functional-spec.md) (:152) +
[REQ-WS-12i](../spec/functional-spec.md) (:165), items 1.3/1.5 + D9
([workspaces](../decisions.md) :247-266,:310-327). Current: stable IDs;
removed/unassigned/out-of-scope clear; toggle no-ops; disconnected
history discarded; reconnect never consults history. Items 1.3/1.5
select invalidation but never call reference retention deliberate,
so they do not settle this.

- Out-of-scope history after migration ([R-WS-26](../spec/reference-outcomes/workspaces.md#r-ws-26-history-hotplug-invalidation)):
  A1 B (drops moved-desktop history); D5 H,S,Q,A,N (retain entries;
  A can select the moved tag on R, N's off-monitor ID no-ops);
  T2 I,P (recorded refill/live-MRU differs, but invalidation of the
  moved entry is not established); U4 C,X,K,R (no history verb).
  Total 1+5+4+2 = 12. Non-scroll: A1 D4 T1 U2, a 4:1 applicable
  majority against clearing. This does not cast bspwm's hotplug
  monitor retention as previous-view history or call awesome unsupported.
- Removed-empty recreation ([R-WS-16](../spec/reference-outcomes/workspaces.md#r-ws-16-previous-after-the-visited-empty-workspace-is-removed)):
  D3 H,I,S (recreate by stored number/name); T1 P (E-removal depends
  on GNOME); U8 C,X,K,R (no verb), B,Q,A,N (E survives in this
  fixture, so removal cannot be exercised). Total 0+3+8+1 = 12.
  COSMIC is unsupported on both legs. Hotplug R-WS-17 additionally
  proves retained out-of-scope entries in H/I/S/N; its final targets
  remain qualified by each profile's global/per-output history.
- Options: (a) keep invalidation; (b) follow retain-majority;
  (c) keep clearing as default, offer a functionally named
  `Previous workspace scope` setting: `Current output only` /
  `Follow surviving workspace` (reference names in tooltips).
- Recommendation: keep (a) with a precise distinction: removed-name
  recreation (H/I/S) creates a new workspace identity, contrary to
  the explicit no-recreation rule. Offer (c) for the meaningful
  surviving-but-moved alternative, with stable-ID lookup and no
  recreation; N-style stale-ID no-op is harmless but offers no user
  benefit. Consequence: default still rejects the 4:1 migration
  majority; opt-in permits a previous-view toggle to change output.

### G-05. Equal partial-zero floats in Ours+COSMIC, tiles in 5/8 (REQ-SPC-04a)

Rule and setting: same D1 as G-01. The delivered both/either-axis
setting keeps identical zero guards, so it does not resolve this leg.

- Partial-zero leg ((640,0)/(0,480)): A3 C,B,X (float raw equality);
  D7 H,I,S,Q,A (tile on gates), P,K (tile: no fixed branch /
  enforced-minimum mapping); T1 N ((640,0) tiles, (0,480) floats:
  one vote cannot cover both variants); U1 R. Total 3+7+1+1 = 12.
  Clear non-scrolling majority (5v3) with COSMIC agreeing.
- Options: (a) keep float (COSMIC default); (b) follow tile majority;
  (c) no new setting (this is a correctness guard, and the existing
  axis setting intentionally leaves guards untouched).
- Recommendation: keep (a) under the COSMIC default; consequence:
  stands against 5 non-scrolling + P/K tiling. User may choose (b);
  that choice redefines equal-partial-zero as non-fixed everywhere.

### G-06. MAX-08 focus permit + unresolved maximized-move suppression (REQ-MAX-08)

Rule: [REQ-MAX-08](../spec/functional-spec.md) (:219, OPEN) linked to
[G-D1](#record-drift) below. Current text records Windows
focus-permit + maximized-move-refusal while status stays unselected.

- Focus leg ([R-MAX-08](../spec/reference-outcomes/maximize-fullscreen.md),
  judged against current PERMIT, not fence): D3 C,H,A (fence by
  early-return / fullscreen-cycle-off / occlusion-miss); A3 Q (wraps
  A-to-C), N (column step, no fence), K (lands on A, clears overlay);
  U6 B,I,X,S (no maximize counterpart), P (width-only conversion),
  R (no native leg). Total 3+3+6+0 = 12. Non-scroll 3 fence vs 1
  access; full 3v3 includes 2 scrolling unfencers.
- Move leg: the sequence attempts focus first, so it is not a
  maximized-mover isolation test. Comparable action-on-maximized-B:
  H refuses (agrees with Windows-refuse direction), C unmaximizes
  then moves B (differs), A swaps B with no tile change (differs);
  Q moves C and N/K/P move A (never exercise a maximized mover).
  Tally: A1 H (refuses); D2 C,A (unmax-move / swap);
  T4 Q,N,K,P (maximized mover unexercised); U5 B,I,X,S,R.
  Total 1+2+4+5 = 12. No invented maximized-mover test claimed.
- Q was not counted as maximized-refusal agreement (mover C is not
  maximum); N/K moves of A were not counted as focused-maximum
  refusal differences.
- Options focus: (a) keep permit; (b) follow C/H/A fence; (c) unfenced
  setting (Q lone non-scroll -> skip per single-outlier rule).
  Options move: (a) keep Windows refusal; (b) follow COSMIC
  unmax-move (single ref).
- Recommendation: resolve G-D1 first (rule OPEN). Then fence focus
  per COSMIC default (C/H/A; consequence: directional focus cannot
  enter/leave a maximized tile, Q + 2 scrolling unfencers opposed).
  Keep move refusal (consequence: stands against COSMIC unmax-move
  alone; moving a maximized window has no majority semantics).

### G-07. Pinned override persists in COSMIC, Ours resets (REQ-CTL-04)

Rule: [REQ-CTL-04](../spec/functional-spec.md) (:326),
[workspaces](../decisions.md) (:148-151). Current: overrides reset on
owner restart. COSMIC `S-cos-persist` keeps the pinned override
(differs; fixture pin status unstated so exact outcome TBD, but the
persist-policy leg is sourced). No recorded coverage.

- Tally: A0 D1 C; U11 H,B,I,X,S,Q,A,N,P,K,R (each explicitly no
  pinned-override counterpart); T0. Total 0+1+11+0 = 12.
- Options: (a) keep reset (session-local; re-pin every restart);
  (b) follow COSMIC (persist pinned overrides; needs a cross-restart
  persisted workspace configuration). No setting (single ref).
- Recommendation: follow (b) under the COSMIC-default rule, subject
  to user decision. Consequence of (b): new
  persisted state + pin-semantics design; consequence of (a): stands
  against COSMIC alone.

### G-37. Migration source refill and destination order (REQ-WS-12d/e)

Rule: [REQ-WS-12d/e](../spec/functional-spec.md) (:160-161),
[workspace migration D4/D5](../decisions.md#workspaces). Current:
insert after target current; show the migrated workspace; source shows
the last remaining scoped entry, with normal spare maintenance.

- Source-refill policy ([R-WS-23](../spec/reference-outcomes/workspaces.md#r-ws-23-source-refill-empty-migrate)):
  A1 C (last remaining); D7 H (first-enumerated/first-free plug),
  B (history-last/head), I (focus-head), S (stacked/first remainder),
  Q (group swap), A (history restore), N (previous entry);
  T1 P (GNOME source lifecycle); U3 X,K,R.
  Total 1+7+3+1 = 12. Non-scroll A1 D6 U1: clear majority differs
  from COSMIC, but no single replacement mechanism has that majority.
  H/B/A exact source identities remain fixture-qualified; this tally
  compares selection policies, not final identities.
- Destination-insertion leg ([R-WS-22](../spec/reference-outcomes/workspaces.md#r-ws-22-active-migrate-layout-retained)):
  A2 C,N (after current); D1 H (in-place creation order);
  T4 B,I,S,P (target insertion order unresolved);
  U5 X,Q,A,K,R (no comparable per-output insertion ordering).
  Total 2+1+5+4 = 12. H alone would not warrant a setting.
- Options: keep last-entry refill; follow a specific majority member
  (no common majority policy); or offer `Source workspace after migration`
  with `Last remaining workspace` (COSMIC tooltip) / `Most recently used
  remaining workspace` (bspwm/i3/awesome tooltip), while retaining the
  destination insertion rule.
- Recommendation: keep the COSMIC last-entry default and offer the MRU
  alternative if selected by the user. This is a meaningful non-scrolling
  history-based split, rather than a new platform-specific mode. Consequence:
  opt-in can choose a different source view after moving its active workspace;
  it needs a defined eligible-history/fallback rule before implementation.

Sum: 8+11+11+8+8+10+11+9+11 = 87. Composite splits name distinct legs
(admit/place, sentinel/partial/zero, ordering/metric/eligibility,
move/focus, target/spare/wrap, behavior/drift); no issue
is double-counted.

## Coverage, ambiguities, checks

- Coverage 87/87; scrolling formal entries 0 (three notes state no
  conflicts; three commits are cell-fill deliveries). Material 8
  (G-01..G-07 and G-37), NOT MATERIAL 35 (G-08..G-45 except G-11/G-24/G-37), RECORD
  DRIFT 2 (G-D1/D2): 45 rule groups total. G-11 was merged into G-04;
  G-24 full-zero normalization was merged into G-01 to retain COSMIC's
  backend-specific guard difference in the material review;
  a separate sticky-scope group was removed because the fixture cannot
  discriminate output scope. IDs are retained for stable review references.
- Open ambiguities: G-06 move leg unexercised for Ours by the matrix
  sequence (no maximized-mover test invented); G-07 pin semantics F
  even in COSMIC (policy leg still clear); G-03 COSMIC exact next-leg
  outcome TBD (avoid-E policy still clear); G-01 COSMIC X11
  full-zero floats while Wayland tiles.
- Arithmetic: every compared leg accounts for all 12 named references;
  source-entry ledger sums to 87. Independent verification covers all
  eight material groups and a non-material/drift sample. Coverage,
  material tallies, classifications and recommendations passed after
  source-grounded reconciliation; no live testing was used.
