# Window Alignment Drag Investigation

## Finding

- Firefox accepts full-height admission and restart restoration; Ghostty's
  persistent short frame remains a separate native per-window constraint
  candidate.
- The replaced `/tmp/dev.log` is `just dev trace`, not `just dev verbose`
  output (`:2,83-84`). It records normal two-window `DP-6` same-scope
  reconcile replies at `:190-257` and writes Firefox back to the retained
  right-hand rectangle while the user holds the shared edge.
- The trace has `drag-pull action=dispatch` at `:230,259`, but no callback,
  verdict, refusal, or `pointer-resize` plan. Ordinary reconciliation, not
  oracle routing, fought the held native resize and parked at `:209,256`.
- The rebuilt-effect warning at `/tmp/dev.log:35-39` is an unconditional
  `justfile:883` staging message, not current effect/service state.

## Correction

- `PlanAdapter` now suppresses only foreground ordinary `reconcile` flights
  while the entry tracks an exact `move === false && resize === true` native
  interaction. A pre-start foreground reconcile is invalidated without a
  geometry write or reconciliation-budget consumption; late callbacks are
  ignored. Background reconciliation and selected work-area reprojection
  remain outside this guard.
- This cancellation drops only KWin's local reply application. `DescribePlan`
  is stateful, but same-bounds `reconcile` is a completed retained projection:
  it stages no Session pending transaction or share/topology change before its
  reply. A later finish resync therefore remains a normal same-session plan.
- The entry requires paired `interactiveMoveResizeStarted` and
  `interactiveMoveResizeFinished` subscriptions before tracking a window.
  Finish clears the exact object-reference guard and uses the adapter's
  existing debounced normal resync. That reasserts retained allocation only;
  it never derives split shares from final native geometry.
- A valid oracle pointer route clears the queued finish resync before it
  dispatches `pointer-resize`, retaining selected native-final-geometry
  authority for intentional shared-boundary changes. If its reply arrives
  after the finish resync dispatches, it cancels that local reconcile reply;
  if the reconcile already wrote, the pointer route still plans and applies
  the oracle-derived boundary.

## Evidence

- A callback must log `drag-verdict` or `drag-reply-invalid`
  (`kwin/src/drag-oracle-pull.ts:77-101`); only a parsed, non-cancelled
  verdict can reach pointer resize (`plan-adapter-entry.ts:2937-2988`).
- The ordinary path is `frameGeometryChanged` subscription
  (`plan-adapter-entry.ts:1743-1803,2192-2199`), foreground drift scheduling
  (`plan-adapter.ts:1728-1998`), and reply-bound geometry writes
  (`:3077-3214`). The guard is local to foreground reconcile operations;
  paired native interaction tracking stays alongside existing oracle starts.
- The active effect's `LastVerdict()` endpoint is read-only
  (`kwin/native-effect/dragoracle.cpp:20-35`).

## Manual Acceptance

- User manually accepted the latest resize reconciliation fix: "Excellent,
  that fixed that specific issue." This accepts only the absence of fighting
  and an incorrect final drop during the tested native resize. It is not
  acceptance of Drag Oracle delivery or Ghostty behavior.

## Current Oracle Diagnosis

- Read-only inspection found KWin 6.7.5 at PID 16891. Its D-Bus
  `listOfEffects` and `loadedEffects` omit both project effects;
  `isEffectSupported("plasma-auto-tiler-drag-oracle")` is false and
  `org.plasmaautotiler.DragOracle` has no owner.
- The staged oracle exists at
  `target/kwin-native-effect-stage/kwin/effects/plugins/plasma-auto-tiler-drag-oracle.so`,
  but the exact documented delivery script
  `~/.config/plasma-workspace/env/60-plasma-auto-tiler-native-effect.sh` is
  absent. The oracle enable key is also absent. Its metadata is
  `EnabledByDefault: false`.
- Reading this KWin process's `/proc/16891/environ` was denied, so its actual
  `QT_PLUGIN_PATH` remains unproven. The missing script establishes that the
  documented delivery route is unconfigured and is a strong candidate for the
  discovery failure; it does not rule out an alternate delivery path.
- The smallest next action requires separate mutation authorization: install
  the exact project delivery script and explicit oracle enable setting, then a
  user-performed logout/login. Re-query discovery after that boundary. If it
  remains false, inspect only that KWin PID's project plugin-load diagnostics;
  the current evidence does not establish an ABI or factory failure.

## Verification

- Hermetic adapter replay covers a pre-start in-flight reconcile, three held
  geometry changes, no held writes or budget consumption, finish correction,
  and pointer-route preemption (`kwin/tests/plan-adapter.test.ts`).
- Hermetic production-entry replay covers paired native start/finish signals,
  held `frameGeometryChanged`, an oracle pull with no callback, and one
  retained finish reconcile. It also covers delayed valid oracle callbacks
  before and after a finish-reconcile reply
  (`kwin/tests/slice2-pointer-route.test.ts`).
- Planner protocol coverage proves a discarded reconcile reply leaves the
  retained session ready for a finish reconcile and a later pointer-resize
  share adjustment (`src/planner_protocol.rs`).
- `npm run typecheck --prefix kwin` passed.
- `cargo test --lib planner_protocol` passed: 84 tests.
- `npm run build --prefix kwin` passed.
- `npm test --prefix kwin` passed: 782 tests.
- `git diff --check` passed.

## Limits

- Implementation verification performed no live KWin, Plasma, D-Bus, or host
  mutation. This record now also includes read-only current-session diagnostics
  and limited manual acceptance of the resize correction; neither verifies
  current native signal timing or oracle delivery on-device.
