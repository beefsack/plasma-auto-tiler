# Windows workspace tiling mode

## Final status

- Complete: original workspace-mode implementation `90ee5c2` plus R-MAX-03
  correction `ace352c`. Earlier incomplete/blocked sections below are historical,
  superseded by the accepted correction at the end of this record.
- Native locked gates, independent review, Notepad/Paint plan/write/matched
  readback and screenshot proof pass. Hosted CI for `ace352c` is green across
  Windows, Linux Rust, KWin, shell, native effect and macOS:
  <https://github.com/beefsack/omnitiler/actions/runs/37196192226>.
- Decisions and R-MAX-03 promoted; record archived. Physical checks remain
  user-owned. Live cleanup independently verified; no Worker remains running.

## Goal and scope

- Match KDE's session-local per-workspace tiled/floating state, current-workspace
  tray checkbox, and persisted `defaultTiled` (initially true).
- Floating preserves native geometry and independent active border, suppresses
  tiling/group underlay/drop preview. Retile explicitly releases the shared
  Engine domain and freshly adopts observed geometry.
- New windows on floating workspaces remain native; cross-boundary sends change
  membership and reflow only the tiled side. Existing individual float/sticky
  and native maximize/fullscreen exceptions retain their semantics.
- No keyboard binding: KDE registers its tray action with an empty sequence.
- No backlog/principles edits, new toolkit/dependencies, registry/policy writes,
  persistent workspace overrides, or unrelated workspace-mode expansion.

## Acceptance and units

1. Implement portable workspace state, shared Engine release integration,
   native runtime/effect/send guards, tray truth, settings store/UI and bounded
   structured logs. Targeted behavior tests and four-package native gates.
2. Independent review of live/state boundaries; correct concrete findings and
   verify current gates. Commit/push accepted implementation; hosted CI green.
3. Scoped live Notepad/Calculator/Paint proof: tray toggle floating, native move,
   new-window admission, retile, sends across both boundaries, effects, default
   and settings UI. Capture screenshots and actual native effect readbacks.
4. Promote decisions, matrix evidence, archive this record, commit/push and
   verify hosted CI plus final clean tree/live state.

## Approach and authorization

- Initial source `7f9b733`, clean main tracking origin/main. KDE reference:
  `tray-workspace-toggle.md`, `tray-toggle-simplicity.md`, decisions Tray,
  `kwin/src/plan-adapter-entry.ts` keyless registration, shared release-domain.
- Existing workspaces take saved default at owner startup; live default edits
  affect only newly created workspaces. Overrides reset on owner restart.
- User standing autonomous authorization permits scoped input, movement,
  hiding/restyling, overlays and disposable Notepad/Calculator/Paint actors.
  Never close/kill/type into hosting Terminal; prefer explicit scope filters.
- Before live work bind artifact/owner/actors to exact identities and capture
  baseline/settings preimage. Use existing proven stop/restore paths. No broad
  cleanup; close only newly opened disposable apps. End with no project actor,
  overlay, ledger or hidden test window; original settings-file state restored,
  normal taskbar, SPI arranging 1 and pen visualization 35.
- Physical input/feel and other output/DPI setups remain user-owned.

## Evidence and decisions

- Research confirms KDE floating/tiled live acceptance and no assigned shortcut.
  Existing shared Engine release is the required reuse boundary; Windows
  managed-workspace mapping owns platform session mode just as KWin does.
- Initial implementation passes native tests/fmt/clippy. Independent review
  found missing tiled-source boundary-send reflow, release losing individual
  floats, stale/duplicate pending releases, unbound tray scope, and directional
  focus divergence. Correct these before acceptance/live proof. A reported
  Settings stale overwrite is rejected: existing full-content Apply refusal
  already reloads without writing (`settings_ui.rs:517`).
- Lead verified corrected native locked build/test/clippy/fmt. Live scoped
  Notepad/Calculator/Paint evidence confirms floating leaves frames untouched,
  native moves persist, new windows remain native, retile freshly fits, border
  remains, settings default applies live only to future workspaces and startup.
- First live Worker incorrectly read a menu screenshot as Tiled checked; Lead
  inspected `shot-menu-boot-floating.png` and rejected that bug claim: Floating
  is correctly checked. No product failed approach or correction follows it.
- Remaining send proof needs a minimal automation `workspace --send` command:
  normal owner intentionally rejects injected keyboard input. Reuse existing
  exact-owner request transport and native send dispatch with all fences.
- Cross-boundary sends and active gesture effects accepted below. Implementation
  `90ee5c2` pushed; hosted Windows/Linux Rust/KWin/shell/macOS CI green:
  <https://github.com/beefsack/omnitiler/actions/runs/37181616531>.
- Final inspection reproduced first-seen maximized-window restore on a floating
  workspace. Mode-gating the admission clear fixes geometry, but first-seen
  maximized rows also need managed workspace membership so switching hides them.
  Two correction approaches have not completed the full invariant; blocked as
  detailed below. Preserve candidate diff; do not commit or archive as complete.

## Accepted verification and outcome

- Four Windows-built packages (`tiler-core`, `tiler-protocol`,
  `tiler-kwin-effect-ffi`, `tiler-windows`) pass locked build/test and strict
  all-target clippy; full rustfmt and diff checks pass after the final CLI
  change. Installed MSVC Cargo used; no dependencies installed. Shared core
  and KDE source remain unchanged; existing `ReleaseDomain` is reused.
- Independent findings corrected: one latest pending release per domain,
  successful-toggle stale release cancellation, exact-lifetime float carry
  across release, native tiled-source survivor reconcile, scoped tray request,
  and KDE-parity floating directional refusal. Existing stale Settings Apply
  refusal was retained. Actual Engine regressions exercise release/fresh float
  admission and native-boundary source removal/reflow; CLI tests cover exclusive
  select/send, malformed actions and exact transport fields.
- Live 2026-10-04, physical Windows 11 Pro build 26200, medium/session 1,
  DISPLAY1 2560x1440, DPI120. Explorer-broker owners scoped to Notepad/Paint
  and ApplicationFrameHost with Calculator child gate, caps <=600 seconds.
  Existing user app windows were controlled but not closed; only newly opened
  Notepad extras were closed. Hosting Terminal was excluded by test scope.
- Initial artifact SHA-256
  `19761840E8FA082D62B9CCAA91389D95D210DF8F510D706B8CA41D4F59D75689`:
  floating toggle preserved all eight frames; a native move survived ticks;
  new Notepad frame remained native; retile released nine-member domain then
  fresh fit with every applied native readback matched. Border remained visible.
  UI Apply saved Floating and owner adopted future-only; fresh startup with
  saved false left all frames untouched. Initial evidence:
  `target/windows-workspace-tiling/20261004-155929-4012/evidence.jsonl`.
- Final source `7f9b733` plus reviewed implementation/CLI diff, artifact
  `target/windows-workspace-tiling/20261004-163221-live/tiler-windows.exe`, SHA-256
  `D649DA769C5B2EC9010900896336BE4D20DA1BE6990287C27E39C1071B1E9A60`.
  Owners bound to creation `01dd53c1fc55a5db` and `01dd53c3d4918d67`.
- Final live boundary roundtrip: Paint sent tiled->floating (`act-111`), frame
  `(1680,694,2560,1319)` unchanged, six source survivors reflowed before hide
  with all six readbacks matched; exact mover foreground confirmed after follow.
  Select-source confirmed filled layout; floating->tiled (`act-157`) admitted
  Paint into a seven-member plan with seven matched writes, no duplicate/missing
  member. No floating-side plan/write. Source action-summary fields are absent
  for the native route; correlated `send-source` tick/readback logs are the
  source effect evidence.
- Actual native title-bar drag shows underlay and preview when tiled; preview
  inspect/log rectangle `[870,694,401,678]` agrees with screenshot. Floating
  drag leaves both absent with `group-underlay reason=floating`, zero shown
  events, and moved native frame persists without snapback.
- Tray default picks both ways save only the default and acknowledge live
  adoption; existing workspace stays tiled, subsequently allocated workspace
  starts floating. Settings shows saved Floating and Close preserves file bytes.
- Lead inspected final menu/UI, floating Paint and tiled/floating drag screenshots.
  Final ignored evidence: `target/windows-workspace-tiling/20261004-163221-live/`.

- Fixture lessons: use exact overflow-icon UIA Invoke and visible menu-row
  coordinates; normal owner filters synthetic keyboard chords/modifier holds,
  so CLI send/native title-bar drag supply valid automated effects. Empty
  intermediate workspace cleanup shifts ordinal indices; re-resolve the live
  scope before the next probe. An invalid suppression probe on a newly tiled
  workspace was rejected and superseded by a correctly toggled floating drag.
  Owner duration expiry was recovered with restore before further testing.
- Final stop/restore, extra-window close and Lead independent read-only recheck:
  no owner/helpers/UI/overlays or recovery ledger/request; original settings-file
  absence restored; numeric SPI GET success with arranging 1 and pen 35; normal
  taskbar and all baseline apps present/visible. Original hosting Terminal PID
  18224 creation `01dd512e9194d8b9` survives. No Worker remains running.
- Provisional decisions: existing JSON field location and minimal exact-owner
  send automation, recorded in `docs/decisions.md`. Runtime behavior follows KDE.

## Residual user-owned checks

- Physical tray/keyboard/mouse feel, rapid workspace/send/toggle use, per-window
  float/sticky/native maximize/fullscreen roundtrip feel, other DPI/outputs.
- Application minimums may still cause overlap/overflow on dense tiled layouts
  under the pre-existing minimum-size policy; workspace-mode toggles do not
  change that policy. No gaming/lock chord was injected in these proofs.

## Blocking admission follow-up (not accepted)

- Required invariant: first-seen maximized windows on a floating workspace
  preserve native geometry, participate in managed hide/reveal, and on first
  tiled admission restore once then receive a real fresh tile. Previously
  slotted native overlays must not re-clear across a mode flip.
- Approach 1: gate `clear_maximize_at_admission` by workspace mode. Reproduction
  on the committed artifact restored a maximized Notepad while default floating;
  the guard fixes that geometry mutation, but leaves first-seen maxima without
  workspace membership, so selecting away does not hide them. Rejected as
  incomplete. Local evidence: `target/windows-workspace-tiling/max-admission/`.
- Approach 2: add exact-lifetime `floating_max_hold`, hidden-frame seed, managed
  membership and release on fresh non-maximized observation. Live proof confirms
  untouched floating maximum and select-away/back hide/reveal, one admission
  clear on retile, and no re-clear after subsequent maximize/mode flips. However
  Lead rejects the claimed fresh tile: after clear, the window stays at native
  restore frame `(40,40,1611,725)`, and the next normal observations still omit
  `w7` from every plan. The fixture incorrectly used `inventory` presence as
  managed/tiled proof. The temporary floating observation seeds an Engine
  exception which `assemble_domain_rows` continues to carry after the hold
  clears. No actual tiled write/readback for the restored window was proven.
- Latest candidate remains uncommitted in `tiling.rs`, `tiling_sys.rs` and
  `tests/tiling.rs`. Native locked build/test/clippy/fmt pass but do not establish
  this missing behavior. Candidate artifact SHA-256:
  `2810681BF0B953340DD8498238A9CCC83878EEFEDE400DF4AC78F8FB581EED8A`.
  Evidence: `target/windows-workspace-tiling/max-membership/evidence.jsonl`;
  owner log `run-01dd53ca153e8b1f.log`, clear at line 863, normal observation
  at 879 and five-window plan at 882 exclude `w7`.
- Candidate also carries native-send source summary/timings through the existing
  action log. Live `act-239` reports source applied 4, mismatched 0, readback_ok
  true and geometry 47ms; this narrowly corrects the earlier absent source
  summary. Floating mover frame remains unchanged. This part is accepted evidence
  but remains in the uncommitted candidate with the admission correction.
- No causal evidence-plumbing repair or product retry follows the second failed
  semantic approach. Stop threshold reached; Orchestrator owns whether to
  authorize a third correction. Exact next action: distinguish the temporary
  max-hold Engine exception from intentional float state on release, then assert
  actual tiled plan/write/native readback after retile before accepting it.
- Final candidate run stopped/restored, exact extras closed, baseline Notepads
  visible, original settings absence restored, project actors/UI/overlays gone,
  SPI numeric arranging 1/pen 35, normal taskbar and original hosting Terminal
  alive. Earlier incorrect SPI action-name readings in this fixture are
  superseded by explicit numeric GET readbacks. No Worker remains running.
- Main implementation `90ee5c2` is pushed with green CI but the overall change
  is incomplete. Keep this record active; backlog must not mark it complete.

## Authorized third correction

- User authorizes one third semantic correction: retire only the temporary
  max-hold Engine exception; prove actual tiled plan, write and native readback,
  run gates, commit/push, green CI and archive. If it fails, discard unaccepted
  source changes, record the known limitation here and in decisions, commit
  documentation and leave the tree clean. No further semantic iteration.
- KDE source establishes parity: `plan-adapter.ts:4905-4909` and `5213-5216`
  skip floating domains before admission clear; `5351-5418` restores unslotted
  maxima once and refetches native state for normal admission, while previously
  applied/slotted windows skip re-clear. Native user restore provides ordinary
  non-maximized observations. Only initial fullscreen has a synthetic floating
  hold (`2249-2297`); no maximize hold exists in KDE.
- Ordinary Windows integration choice: exclude only retired temporary max-hold
  state from Engine-exception feedback on fresh admission. Preserve exact
  lifetime/scope fences, intentional float/sticky/fullscreen state and previously
  slotted overlays. No new behavioral divergence or provisional choice needed.
- Third correction failed live; user-authorized fallback executed below.

## Third correction outcome and known limitation

- KDE behavior is established by source, not ambiguous: floating skips clear;
  first tiled admission of an unslotted maximum restores once and refetches for
  fresh tiling. A previously slotted native maximum skips admission clear and
  restores through ordinary native-state observation. No provisional divergence
  was selected.
- Third approach added exact-lifetime released-max tracking and excluded that
  token's stale Engine exception from observation/write eligibility, preserving
  intentional floats. An actual Engine regression passed flag adoption into a
  tiled plan; this did not prove the Windows owner supplied that observation.
- Candidate locked four-package build/test/clippy/fmt passed. Live final
  artifact `target/windows-workspace-tiling/third-correction/tiler-windows.exe`
  SHA-256 `8A274DC470F7BB9BAC76CA121688333CF3BAF92BE91B9761FB6385F5A64C2130`,
  source `90ee5c2` plus rejected candidate diff. Scoped Explorer-broker owner
  creation `01dd53cd55933c0b`, medium/session 1, Notepad only, DPI120 display.
- Live floating maximum and select-away/back geometry/visibility passed, but
  retile failed the required effect criterion: after one clear the frame
  remained `(120,120,1691,805)` through a 12-second settle. Token `w8` never
  appeared in a tiled plan, write or matched readback. Observation assignment
  seeded `member_rects` before the suppression gate, so its `known_slot` test
  prevented retiring the temporary Engine exception. No follow-up correction
  or further semantic iteration was attempted.
- Evidence retained locally under ignored
  `target/windows-workspace-tiling/third-correction/evidence.jsonl` and owner
  log `run-01dd53cd55933c0b.log`. Lead inspected the final checked-Tiling menu
  screenshot; that check proves only mode, not tile admission. Screenshot
  `shot-menu-tiled.png` SHA-256:
  `2BF8F34CEA1DA1D978EE804D5423A9A9C1D5E34B5D95A28901AF36990634126A`.
- Per user fallback, all unaccepted changes in `tiler-windows` source/tests
  and `tiler-core/tests/session_observation_convergence.rs` were discarded to
  `90ee5c2`. This also discards the uncommitted source-summary/timing repair.
  Earlier candidate evidence remains historical only; no candidate source or
  regression is delivered. Committed native-send source tick/readback evidence
  remains valid even though its action summary has no source summary.
- Known limitation of retained implementation `90ee5c2`: first-seen maximized
  windows may be restored prematurely on a floating workspace because the
  admission clear precedes the mode gate. Full KDE parity for this case remains
  incomplete. The rejected hold/release implementations and their stale
  exceptions are not shipped. Record this as a defect in decisions and R-MAX-03;
  keep this one change record active, not archived as completed.
- Stop/restore succeeded, exact newly opened Notepad closed, baseline five
  Notepad HWNDs preserved, settings-file absence restored, project actors and
  recovery effects removed, numeric SPI GET arranging 1/pen 35, normal taskbar,
  original hosting Terminal alive. No Worker remains running. Final Lead
  independent recheck confirms owner/UI/ledger/pending/request absent, settings
  absent, both SPI GET calls successful with 1/35, and original Terminal PID
  18224 creation `01dd512e9194d8b9` unchanged.
- After discarding the candidates, the retained `90ee5c2` source passes locked
  four-package native build/test, strict all-target clippy, full rustfmt and diff
  checks. Only this record, decisions and the outcome matrix are committed in
  the fallback follow-up; no further source change or live attempt.
- Exact next action: none in this unit. Any further admission correction needs
  a separately authorized task; backlog should retain the known limitation.

## Bounded R-MAX-03 follow-up

- User authorizes fresh investigation, deterministic failing offline reproduction,
  then at most two semantic candidates with live Notepad/Paint plan/write/native
  readback and screenshots. Native gates, independent live-boundary review,
  commit/push and green hosted CI are required. Discard unaccepted changes if
  both candidates fail; preserve findings and keep this record active.
- Candidate 1 follows KDE's separation of workspace membership from Engine
  admission: first-seen maxima join slotless without synthetic floating state;
  floating skips clear and slot seeding, first tiled admission clears once and
  refetches ordinary state. Prior exception-release approaches are not reused.
- Offline reproduction before production edits failed with `floating first-seen
  maximum must keep its native frame` (`cargo test --locked -p tiler-windows
  --test tiling r_max_03`). Candidate Windows source/test changes pass native
  tests, strict clippy and format checks. Live effect acceptance remains pending.

## R-MAX-03 accepted correction

- Candidate 1 accepted after independent review and Lead inspection. Windows
  classified first-seen maxima as retained, outside normal membership admission;
  its clear ran before the workspace-mode gate. Temporary Engine floats in the
  rejected candidates conflated native maximum state with intentional float.
  The correction separates slotless membership from Engine admission: preserve
  floating maximum, seed no tile slot during floating release assembly, clear
  once on tiled admission, then refetch and tile normally. Exact-lifetime/scope
  fences remain; intentional float/sticky/fullscreen lanes retain their rules.
- The regression was strengthened after review to run actual Windows
  `assemble_domain_rows` on floating retained and tiled refetched observations,
  the real Engine and production writable selection. Removing the slot-seed
  guard makes it fail. Portable admission/Engine tests cover one-shot clear,
  slotted skip and intentional float. No shared core/KDE source changes.
- Lead independently ran locked build/test and strict all-target clippy for all
  four Windows-built packages, full rustfmt and diff checks after the final
  source/test edit: all pass. Accepted commit `ace352c` pushed; hosted CI green
  across all six jobs (run linked in Final status).
- Live 2026-10-04, Windows 11 build 26200, medium/session 1, DISPLAY1
  2560x1440/work 2560x1380, DPI120. Artifact SHA-256
  `F29F89325468826E043841823BC797E798FBCB50FD4E3FC8F3AB8471C58821B5`,
  source `84c34b6` plus accepted Windows diff. Explorer-broker owners scoped
  Notepad/Paint; hosting Terminal excluded. Both new maximized actors preserve
  their floating frames with zero clear/write and hide/reveal maximized intact.
- Notepad owner `01dd53e92e1d1445`: token `w7`, exactly one clear, correlation
  `tick-26` has plan/native write/target-entry matched readback all
  `[8,8,1268,1364]`, agreeing with fresh DWM frame `(8,8,1276,1372)`.
  Previously slotted remax stays maximized through floating/tiled flips with no
  re-clear. Native restore returns to that tile; subsequent ticks 70/71 have
  plan and matched readback with zero writes because geometry already agrees.
  Accepted as a no-op restore, not a fresh-admission write claim.
- Paint owner `01dd53ec4fd098a8`: token `w5`, exactly one clear, `tick-18`
  plan/native write/matched target readback all `[8,8,1268,1364]`, fresh DWM
  agreement `(8,8,1276,1372)`, stable at tick 33. Lead inspected both tiled-frame
  screenshots. Accepted local evidence:
  `target/windows-workspace-tiling/rmax03-final/` (Notepad) and
  `target/windows-workspace-tiling/rmax03-paint-native/` (Paint).
- Screenshot SHA-256:
  - Notepad `shot-np-tiled-frame.png`:
    `850428CFFCE154FB57AAAF2DF80478B7FF16EB3C6866BD9DEBC33BCA9C0A0A10`.
  - Paint `shot-paint-tiled-frame.png`:
    `B9F2603C7915DC906EE800854EA4A0E6E492AC09A408C1DE5C9571ADE00ACA1A`.
- Fixture findings: post-toggle samples can already be tiled; compare DWM
  extended-frame coordinates, not invisible native borders. Anchor initial
  admission proof on the same token/tick/correlation for plan/write/matched
  readback. UIA icon/menu discovery failed pre-effect for Paint; its accepted
  proof opens the exact owner's normal tray menu via synthetic tray callback,
  then official `GetMenuBarInfo`/`GetMenuStringW`/`GetMenuItemRect` identify the
  enabled checkbox and exact click rectangle. No production fixture path added.
  Harness-only parsing/marshalling failures were repaired; one semantic candidate,
  zero failed product approaches in this follow-up. Earlier three rejected
  approaches remain historical evidence above.
- Every owner stopped/restored, all new extras closed by exact identity. Lead
  read-only recheck confirms baseline five Notepads/one Paint visible, settings
  original absence restored, no owner/helper/UI/overlay/ledger/pending/request,
  successful numeric SPI GET arranging 1/pen 35, normal taskbar, original hosting
  Terminal alive with unchanged creation. No Worker remains running.
- No new provisional product decision. Physical feel, rapid toggles and other
  DPI/output setups remain user-owned. Decisions/matrix updated and record
  archived after hosted CI green. Exact next action: none for this correction;
  Orchestrator owns advancing the backlog and its archived-record link.
