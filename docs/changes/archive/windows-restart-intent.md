# Windows restart intent

- Goal: handoff item 8, R-RST-01 / R-FLT-05. Intentional floats and sticky floats from both origins survive owner restart.
- Scope: Windows adapter on-window markers, classification hydration, exact-lifetime fences, regression coverage and agent-owned restart journeys. No store file, recovery-ledger changes or layout restoration.
- Acceptance: settled explicit intent persists; fresh admitted lifetimes hydrate before tiling; sticky remains sticky; corrupt/unreadable markers diagnose and mean no intent; markers grant no write/recovery authority. Same-owner origin behavior remains; post-restart un-stick TBD and REQ-RST-01c unresolved.
- Approach: namespaced SetProp markers, following existing sticky mechanism. Reserve fixed tile-override marker for item 13/D7. Tentative, pending user review: stronger project namespace for all classification markers, without accepting old ambiguous names.
- Units: Windows implementation/regressions; independent authorization/lifetime review; native gates and scoped live restart verification; documentation and publication.
- Verification: native build/test/fmt/clippy gates for core/protocol/FFI/Windows; diff check; exact-owner CLI journeys with owned disposable windows and independent stop/restore proof; CI after push.
- Live authority: Windows 11 physical host, ordinary integrity, only session-created Notepad/Calculator/Paint or owned helper windows; owner hooks/overlay and synthetic input authorized. No pre-existing window mutation, Win+G/Win+F11, games, elevated or protected resources. End owner stopped, hooks released, hidden windows revealed, owned settings restored and test apps closed.
- Status: item 8 delivered 2026-10-11, base `e48aed1` plus delivery commit. Windows adapter only; no shared-core, KDE, store-file or recovery-ledger changes. Item 13/D7 remains unwired.

## Accepted implementation and review

- `PlasmaAutoTiler.Sticky.v1`, `PlasmaAutoTiler.FloatIntent.v1` and reserved
  `PlasmaAutoTiler.TileOverride.v1` are distinct window-lifetime properties.
  Tentative, pending user review: rename sticky too and ignore the old
  `PlasmaAutoTilerSticky`; pre-release upgrades do not hydrate that old name.
- Successful explicit native float/sticky application writes and verifies
  markers through existing held-process/member-tag gates. Settled unfloat and
  sticky-off clear the corresponding markers; sticky-off-to-float repairs
  ordinary intent. Adoption preserves live frames and markers, changes only
  classification, and grants no native-effect or independent-recovery authority.
- `adopt_restart_markers` stages all valid admitted markers, then reconciles
  once per domain before first tiling. A mixed four-window real-`TileLoop`
  regression covers both observation orders; both sticky origins also survive
  two fresh Engine owners. Corrupt values, absent markers, lifetime refusal,
  actual property install/remove and retained Engine membership are covered.
- Independent review accepted exact-owner controls, admission/lifetime fences
  and the narrow owned-band hide exception. Native-success/readback failure
  preserves local/native truth and logs a degraded outcome.
- `GetPropW` provides NULL for absence without a reliable read-error distinction.
  NULL is therefore silent no-intent; present invalid values diagnose corrupt
  no-intent. The classifier supports diagnosed unreadable inputs, but the native
  reader cannot claim it distinguishes every unreadable NULL from absence.
- Tentative, pending user review: `workspace --float` / `--sticky` are test-needed
  consume-once exact-owner controls, reusing the workspace request transport.
  They resolve current foreground and call production intent dispatch with all
  fences; proof owners refuse, no HWND is transported. Outer logs say `cli`;
  the inner intent uses the existing down-edge vocabulary, not physical evidence.
- The live scope journey exposed an existing contradiction: explicit floats
  raise keep-above, but hide admission refused all topmost windows. Only a fresh
  exact-key runtime record proving a project-raised band (`Some(false)`) can
  bypass that one refusal. Pre-existing topmost and marker-only windows still
  refuse; identity, lifetime, held process, journal and restore gates remain.
  Per-window `workspace-hide` diagnostics are bounded to 64 per selection.

## Native gates and live evidence

- Rust 1.99.0 MSVC, mise auto-install disabled. Locked build/test for core,
  protocol, KWin-effect FFI and Windows passed after the final code change;
  Windows lib 243, all executed suites green. Whole-workspace fmt check,
  four-package all-target clippy `-D warnings` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Agent-observed, Windows 11 Pro 26300, medium integrity 8192/session 1;
  DISPLAY1 full `[0,0,2560,1440]`, work `[0,0,2560,1380]`, DPI120.
  Four exact-owned Explorer-brokered helper HWNDs: 5047720/PID3668,

  launch `tile --user-start --seconds 300 --trace --scope-exe tiler-test-window.exe`.
- Independent graceful stop/restore proof preceded the accepted journey.
  Two graceful restarts kept both sticky origins and ordinary intentional float,
  with raw markers unchanged before stop, after restore and after new-owner
  readiness; float frames unchanged and no hydration writes. Before restart and
  after each restart, selecting WS2 kept both stickies visible at the same frame
  while ordinary float/tile hid; returning WS1 revealed them. No candidate
  rejection/unfloated diagnostics in the accepted journey.
- Post-restart un-stick observed: prior-tiled marker cleared and tiled; prior-float
  sticky marker cleared, float marker remained, live float frame kept. These are
  observations only: R-FLT-05 un-stick remains TBD, REQ-RST-01c remains unresolved
  OPEN for this delivery. Physical shortcuts/app dogfood remain user-owned.
- End: owner/processes stopped, hooks released through exit, zero overlays,
  independent restore clean, all four helpers closed, original settings absence
  restored, arranging1/pen35 restored, inventory19->19, unrelated windows intact.

## Failures and reusable discoveries

- One semantic restart failure: per-window hydration seeded a later marked
  window as retained tiled focus, then its float flip rejected `focus-mismatch`.
  The marker was intact. Four-window reproduction failed before the batched
  repair and passes after; the accepted live journey verifies the same fix.
- Temp-harness faults are not product evidence: AST function imports omitted
  topmost constants/transitive dependencies; dot-sourcing `windows-dev.ps1`
  reset `$TileArgs` to empty. Literal native masks and uniquely named launch
  arguments set after sourcing fixed them. Prior keep-above/OS-broker and
  marker-loss explanations were withdrawn. No OS security changes were needed.
- An early Worker ran forced-loss preflight beyond this unit's graceful-only
  brief. It reported exact-owned cleanup; those probes are not accepted feature
  evidence. Subsequent units explicitly excluded forced loss.
- Floated foreground can produce existing reconcile focus-mismatch diagnostics;
  shared core was left untouched. This is separate from restart hydration.
- Item 13+17 next: wire bounded max-track observation, schema-v1 predicate/UI,
  automatic origin and D5/D6 no-touch admission, then D7 using the reserved
  tile marker/native ops. Preserve batched hydration and exact-lifetime fencing;
  enable Engine fixed-size admission only after full Windows observation/origin
  wiring. Reuse exact-owner CLI and corrected harness dependencies above.
