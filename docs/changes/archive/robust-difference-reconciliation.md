# Robust difference reconciliation - phase 1 (2026-09-28)

## Goal and boundary

Unify event-driven complete-observation comparison for foreground and hidden
domains without changing the existing Rust operation, native write, or reply
fences. Size learning and neighbour replanning are phase 2, after user testing
of phase 1. Preserve owner, identity, revision, scope, reply-boundary and
no-post-setter-replay fences.

## Current state and failure modes

| What is compared today | Source | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KWin collects fresh per-domain frames, flags, min/max hints; incomplete foreground or hidden domains cannot prove departures. Foreground and hidden each compare a carried snapshot against per-id applied geometry/flags and per-domain bounds/gaps to choose quiet, reproject or dispatch. | `kwin/src/plan-adapter-entry.ts:1604-1674,1728-1781`; `kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts:4729-4946,4971-5051,5094-5319` | Two partially duplicated comparison paths, including sticky multi-home and work-area exceptions; they can diverge. Quiet equality is an optimization, not proof of a completed native write. |
| Rust `Engine` converges complete membership/floating observations before ordinary operations, retaining topology; `reconcile` projects it. Minimum hints borrow slack from siblings; hint-explained clamp and overconstraint skip writes. | `crates/tiler-core/src/session/world.rs:671-988`; `crates/tiler-core/src/engine.rs:278-340,601-674`; `crates/tiler-core/src/size_hints.rs:9-58,251-305`; `crates/tiler-core/src/boundary.rs:677-698,706-808`; `kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts:7469-7497` | Hints are ephemeral; unhinted Ghostty shortfalls remain drift. Existing maximums *do not* redistribute spare space, and step/increment is not observed on the wire (`size_hints.rs:26-43`). |
| An applied reply records *planned* rectangles, including fullscreen/maximized slots, not confirmed compositor frames; overlay frames are replaced by carried slot rectangles for Plan. Three pure-drift reassertions then accept exact client-held rectangles as applied evidence. | `kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts:2200-2285,4444-4485,4917-4946,7770-7873` | Interim A stops repeated writes but can leave a visible gap or reassert the accepted rect when a neighbour drifts (`docs/decisions.md:541-552`; `docs/backlog.md:145-151`). It never replans around the short window. |

| Signal / special trigger relied on | Source | Failure when missed or unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frameGeometryChanged`, `windowAdded/Removed/Activated` and `screensChanged/currentDesktopChanged` drive the debounced Plan refresh; geometry/scope and lifecycle subscriptions are required. | `kwin/src/plan-adapter-entry.ts:2293-2319,2970-3004,3039-3050`; `kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts:4565-4660` | A state change without any subscribed edge is invisible until a later event/command. An unreadable subscription can stop attach. Sleep without a native edge is idle (`docs/changes/archive/recovery-process-sleep-audit.md:20-24,43`). |
| Per-window `fullScreenChanged`, `maximizedChanged`, `desktopsChanged` refresh flags; missing per-window maximize is soft, but list-level maximize subscription failure refuses attach. Fresh observations reread `maximizeMode`. | `kwin/src/plan-adapter-entry.ts:2335-2436,2453-2481,3006-3038,1670-1674` | Signal-less maximize stays tiled and an unseen transition stays unknown until a later observation (decision I, `docs/decisions.md:471-482`). Fullscreen/sticky changes similarly await another observation if their best-effort signal is absent. |
| Exact-reference maximize/sticky write echoes, pointer neighbour echo, interactive drag/resize finish, and send/R4 terminal force are separate gates around automatic refresh. | `kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts:4337-4434,4600-4648,4849-4907`; `kwin/src/plan-adapter-entry.ts:3758-3798` | Losing a finish can defer drag restoration; omitting terminal forced source/target refresh can leave otherwise equal applied evidence unexamined. Echoes guard user actions and must not be dropped merely because ordinary refresh is unified. |
| Native effect seeds maximize/fullscreen on load, then follows native maximize/fullscreen signals for border/group visibility. Drag oracle uses a matched modifier press; absent press falls back to a 64 px interior classifier. | `kwin/native-effect/activewindowborder.cpp:383-435,766-795`; `kwin/src/drag-oracle-pull.ts:110-119,140-196` | Script-level geometry comparison cannot attest rendered pixels or invent effect transitions. The 64 px gate can misclassify a border/scale case; it is a drag-intent issue, not a size limit (`docs/decisions.md:1020-1039`). |

Concrete size evidence: `p13` bottom edge short by 36 px
(`docs/backlog.md:33-40`); W3 requested `502x1092`, held `502x1036`
(`docs/backlog.md:387-401`); R4 Ghostty requested `1012x1092`, held
`1012x1036` (`docs/backlog.md:450-463`). Recorded hints do not explain the 56 px cases; native cause
remains unknown. No inference from those examples alone establishes a maximum,
minimum, increment, output-scale cause or compositor acceptance. A single
observed size is consistent with several of them.

## Options (rough production scope, before tests)

| Option | Mechanism and learned-size handling | Replace/delete; rough size | Risks and observability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Keep current per-signal + interim A | Each signal queues existing foreground/hidden refresh; no durable size learning. | No change. | Lowest migration cost; Ghostty gap and unseen signal-less change remain. Existing `reconcile-accepted`, constraint trace and write dispositions identify symptoms, not their cause. |
| 2. One event-driven difference path (recommended foundation) | Any existing native event, explicit command, configuration change or terminal flight requests fresh complete observations. One comparator classifies membership/flags/scope/geometry for foreground and hidden; portable convergence remains in Rust. Treat all signals as *hints to observe*, not facts to patch state. Phase 2 adds per-live-window effective size constraints from held-size evidence; project siblings from retained topology, without adopting observed rects as shares. | Consolidate duplicated `refreshForegroundNow`/`hiddenIntentFor` equality, scope and drift selection; remove redundant per-signal reassert/quiet shortcuts only after equivalence tests. Keep native echo/drag/flight/transport fences. Phase 1 likely a few hundred lines changed, aiming net deletion; learning/projector phase a few hundred more, offset by deleting interim A accounting. | No event still means no detection. Transient asynchronous frames must not be learned. Correlated normal-level classification (`equal/change/uncertain`, reason and terminal), learned/expired/reprojected transition and per-window write outcomes; high-volume rect/hint details only in redacted trace. |
| 3. Periodic complete observations | Option 2 plus a justified idle cadence while active to discover changes with **no** signal or command. Same evidence rules for learning; no second reconciler. | Option 2 plus timer lifecycle, dedup, hidden-domain budgeting and tests (hundreds more lines); cannot delete native input/echo fences. | Load/latency, session wake storms and fighting asynchronous clients; bound by measured CPU/IPC and stale-frame tests before setting a cadence. Log changed state and bounded idle health, not every poll. |

## Recommended scope and acceptance

1. **Small shippable first phase: event-driven comparison only.** Unify the
   common foreground/hidden applied-vs-complete-observed classification, with
   explicit exceptions for hidden sticky multi-home, overlay carried slots,
   initial fullscreen hold, work-area reprojection and explicit complete empty.
   Run it on all existing refresh/command/terminal edges; pass one classification
   to the existing Rust `reconcile` or `update-gaps` path. Delete duplicate
   comparisons and obsolete signal-specific *policy* as proved by tests; keep
   signal subscriptions as inexpensive wakeups and keep exact echo/flight
   safety and interactive suppression. No new polling, wire shape, or learning
   yet. Acceptance: foreground/hidden equality dispatches nothing; membership,
   flags, valid scope change, raw out-of-bounds and client drift dispatch the
   proper operation; unreadable domains do not imply departure; overlay and
   sticky windows do not ping-pong; pending replies never act on a changed
   scope; post-command/send refresh preserves the existing single-flight and
   once-only follow. CI's KWin tests/typecheck and Rust tests/fmt/Clippy stay
   green; production-path diff is net deletion or explicitly justified.
2. **Learn and replan only on size evidence.** In the portable policy, compare
   desired vs fresh observed rects after a known geometry attempt has ended,
   outside interactive gestures and pending writes, with stable identity/scope,
   repeatable client-held evidence and no explanatory native min/max hint.
   Do not infer a true min/max/step from a single result:
   record the tested desired/held axis as an *effective* constraint for this
   window. Repeated independent desired/held pairs can support a minimum,
   maximum or increment; ambiguous evidence retains interim per-window
   acceptance without fabricating a constraint. Project with a feasible
   learned lower or upper limit and redistribute the surplus/deficit to
   siblings; keep topology/shares and observed-vs-desired distinct. Clear
   learning on changed client-held size or native identity, and reconsider it
   on changed hints, mode or scope; do not erase it on our own unchanged
   setter echo. When infeasible, retain overconstrained/skip behavior rather
   than fight the client. Replace interim three-strike acceptance *only for*
   explained learned differences; remove its obsolete counter once all cases
   have a defined no-fight fallback. Acceptance: a repeatable Ghostty-class
   shortfall can give neighbours the spare height without a write loop or
   visible unallocated strip where feasible; spontaneous client size change
   invalidates learning and reprojects; hint-clamped and overconstrained cases
   still work; no position-drift learning, false step inference, permanent park,
   setter replay, or revision/share change from a pure observation.

Live test outline (user-executed after implementation, not run for this draft):
follow `docs/live-kwin-testing.md`, capture exact project-only baseline and
restore it; start `just dev trace` with two adjacent normal windows, reproduce
the 56 px Ghostty and `p13` shortfalls on the relevant output, compare fresh
window frames, bounds, hints and correlated planned/write/post-observation
records. Then resize the client itself, resize/move a neighbour, change
work area/output, maximize/unmaximize with and without the per-window signal,
and revisit a hidden workspace. Look for one converged replan, filled available
area when feasible, expiration on client change, no oscillation and usable
subsequent command. Test a genuinely signal-less change with a *later unrelated
event* separately from idle detection. Native effect border pixels and drag
64 px classification need separate visual/oracle tests; Plan logs alone do not
prove them. No live claim yet.

## Selected decisions (user, 2026-09-28)

- Detect on existing events or the next command only; no polling. Evaluate this in live testing.
- Learn size limits only from settled, repeatable evidence (phase 2).
- Replan neighbours around learned limits only; native maximum behavior is unchanged (phase 2).
- Limit implementation to the KWin script and Rust tiling; the native effect is unchanged.
- Added complexity must deliver more value than it costs.

## Phase-1 work and verification

- Consolidate foreground/hidden complete-observation comparison into one classifier while retaining overlay, sticky, fullscreen-hold, work-area, empty and unreadable-domain semantics.
- Preserve native echo, interactive, flight and reply fences; route the classification through existing reconciliation/update-gaps on current refresh edges.
- Add proportionate behavior tests, run KWin tests and typecheck, and verify any affected scripts. Record evidence and archive this note after acceptance; phase 2 waits for phase-1 user testing.
- Implementation boundary: share per-id membership/flag/carried-rect, per-domain scope and raw out-of-bounds classification inside `plan-adapter.ts`. Keep foreground and hidden dispatch gates distinct: foreground reprojection permits same-id flag drift; hidden reprojection requires pure drift. Explicit empty, per-domain removal bookkeeping, pointer echo and the existing per-domain/global three-strike counters stay at their existing call sites.
- First green point: shared classifier integrated; `kwin/npm test` 794 passing and `npm run typecheck` passing. Review follow-up removed redundant per-id scans and added hidden sticky/gap behavior coverage; 796 KWin tests and typecheck passed after the shared scope comparison integration.

## Phase-1 outcome (offline)

- `kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts` now classifies complete carried foreground and hidden observations against applied membership/flags/rect, scope and raw bounds once per refresh path. Hidden sticky multi-home forgives matching sticky homing; explicit empty requires applied evidence; fullscreen hold and overlay carried slots remain pre-classification. Existing foreground/hidden operation gates retain their distinct work-area and gap behavior. A bounded normal-level `route-diag` records equal/change/uncertain, reason, terminal and flight correlation where available, without native ids or rectangles.
- Production `kwin/src/plan-adapter.ts`: +236/-284 = -48 lines. Tests: `kwin/tests/plan-adapter.test.ts` +110/-2 and `kwin/tests/background-empty-domain.test.ts` +166 = +274 lines. Duplicate membership/flag/rect, raw-bound and scope comparisons were removed; no wire, Rust, effect, signal, polling or interim-acceptance changes.
- Acceptance evidence: foreground equality, drift and raw out-of-bounds dispatch and flag-differing work-area reprojection have new behavior tests. Hidden sticky multi-home quiet and one-shot gap `update-gaps` have new behavior tests. Existing KWin coverage verifies foreground/hidden arrivals, departures, flags, scope and explicit empties; unreadable quarantine and force retention; overlay and initial-fullscreen hold; interactive and pointer echoes; pending changed-scope reply rejection; post-command and terminal send/R4 source/target single-flight and once-only follow. `kwin/npm test`: 796 passed, 0 failed (790 baseline). `npm run typecheck` and `git diff --check` pass. No affected `scripts/*.test.sh`; no Rust changes.
- Live checks for the user: single-output test system - compare equal/change/uncertain logs and write counts across newcomer/close, flag transition, client-held drift, work-area change, fullscreen/maximize entry/exit, interactive resize finish and a later event after a signal-less change. Multi-output test system - exercise hidden workspaces, sticky multi-home, output/work-area transitions, unreadable output quarantine, delayed/stale replies and immediate/delayed send/R4 arrival; confirm once-only follow and forced source/target refresh. Follow `docs/live-kwin-testing.md` for any later authorized live run. Phase-2 size evidence is deliberately not evaluated here.
- Remaining risk: no native live confirmation of event delivery or client geometry behavior; signal-less idle changes remain undiscovered until the next event/command by decision. No product open question. Exact next action: none for this phase; user tests phase 1 before considering phase 2.
