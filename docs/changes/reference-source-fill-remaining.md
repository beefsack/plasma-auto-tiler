# Remaining reference source-fill triage

## Goal and scope

Triage all remaining reference TBD cells by WM to select high-yield,
context-bounded source passes. The initial triage classified existing evidence;
the counts and ledgers now include the completed PaperWM, karousel, paneru,
COSMIC, xmonad, awesome, bspwm, Hyprland, qtile and niri source passes recorded in
[PaperWM's outcome note](archive/paperwm-reference-source-fill.md)
and [karousel's outcome note](archive/karousel-reference-source-fill.md), plus
[paneru's outcome note](archive/paneru-reference-source-fill.md) and
[COSMIC's outcome note](archive/cosmic-reference-source-fill.md) and
[xmonad's outcome note](archive/xmonad-reference-source-fill.md) and
[awesome's outcome note](archive/awesome-reference-source-fill.md) and
[bspwm's outcome note](archive/bspwm-reference-source-fill.md) and
[Hyprland's outcome note](archive/hyprland-reference-source-fill.md) and
[qtile's outcome note](archive/qtile-reference-source-fill.md) and
[niri's outcome note](archive/niri-reference-source-fill.md) and
[sway's outcome note](archive/sway-reference-source-fill.md). No scenarios
were tightened. Documentation only; no live
testing, cloning, new source pins, source-checkout changes, or stash changes.
Ours is counted separately and is out of scope for reference source tracing.

## Initial triage acceptance and approach

- Reconcile every reference TBD cell to one primary blocker class, using
  existing cell/row/profile text and light pinned-source inspection for ambiguity.
- Report per-WM totals/classes, not-attempted area splits, missing-host-source
  and fixture-gap aggregates, and ranked expected source-pass yields.
- Independently spot-check a classification sample with a separate Worker.
- Verify coverage, counts, unchanged matrix/scenarios, diff scope and whitespace;
  commit and push this report only.

## Initial triage bounded units

1. Inventory plus one bounded per-WM classification unit at a time.
2. Reconcile aggregates and rank per-WM passes split by area.
3. Independent spot-check, report integration, checks, commit and push.

Workers use muse-spark, one active at a time. The Lead owns this note.

## Current evidence and classification method

- Initial triage baseline: `f4ad288`, 2026-10-09, committed as `abf7f26`.
  All 1,006 TBD reference cells out of 1,896 classified; triage alone closed
  zero cells. Current: **549 reference TBD**, after 42 PaperWM, 37 karousel,
  51 paneru, 29 COSMIC, 48 xmonad, 36 awesome, 53 bspwm, 44 Hyprland,
  43 qtile, 44 niri and 30 sway closures.
  **Ours: 169 TBD**, excluded.
- Twelve reference profiles, as pinned in the [matrix index](../spec/reference-outcomes.md#wm-profiles-and-config-assumptions).
  KWin is not a separate column. Karousel's host KWin is already pinned at
  `8438567a` (`S-kwin-resizeable`, `S-kwin-tabbox`, `S-kwin-act`); unfinished
  tracing at that revision is not missing-host-source.
- Each cell counts once if it contains TBD, regardless of the number of TBD
  tokens. Separate explicit-swap cells under MOV-01/MOV-03 count separately.
  Five repeated WM/area/row triples give 1,006 cells but 1,001 distinct triples:
  Hyprland MOV-01/03, PaperWM MOV-01/03, paneru MOV-01.
- Workers read each remaining cell, its Given/When/Observe, global profile and
  existing notes; ambiguous cases received light source inspection, not full
  tracing. Existing source citations support triage but do not prove closure.
  A primary class identifies the selected remaining blocker; compound cells
  retain secondary limitations in the yield qualification below.
- **N, not-attempted:** the unresolved leg has not received adequate tracing
  and is likely answerable from pinned source. A partially sourced cell can
  still be N; the label concerns its remaining leg, not absence of source tags.
- **H, missing-host-source:** decisive policy resides in an unpinned external
  codebase, named below. Already-pinned dependencies do not qualify.
- **F, fixture-gap:** scenario/profile/action wording omits an input the code
  depends on, named below. Observe controls required precision.
- **L, live-only:** remaining outcome depends on runtime timing, client
  response or observation, rather than an unfinished deterministic policy trace.
- **U, unsupported-pending:** cited inventories establish no in-profile
  counterpart; explicit unsupported-outcome wording is the cheap closure.
- Reusable prior evidence: six preceding source groups reduced TBDs
  1,050 -> 1,006 (44 net); their detailed changes remain in git history.
  Qtile minimize retains group current with floating-layout bookkeeping;
  restore fresh-admits and focuses through the tiled layout when current.
  PaperWM selected-window
  reinsertion is now traced: selected+1 RIGHT; host-selected anchors remain
  qualified where needed. PaperWM has native live-alt-tab; do not repeat
  the old absence claim.
  Preserve unknown user-tested versions and the distinction between policy
  evidence and runtime acceptance. Approved deliberate deviations remain intact.
- Source access: some `/tmp/opencode` COSMIC/Hyprland/bspwm exports were
  empty or mismatched and were not accepted as pinned evidence. Workers used
  existing pinned citations, verified sibling checkouts where available, and
  pinned raw files for light checks. No sources were cloned or newly pinned.

main and explicit-swap cells are now closed. Both Hyprland MOV-01/03 legs
are F, not N.

## Missing-host-source aggregate

Counts are unique **primary H cells per external source group**, indicating
source legs that could be unlocked, not guaranteed whole-cell completion.
GNOME Shell includes its `org.gnome.shell.app-switcher` schema; Shell/Mutter
are grouped because several PaperWM cells span both. Their union is now 38
(17 existing plus 21 reclassified after extension tracing). The other primary
H cells are sway 3, paneru 28, karousel 1, COSMIC 1, xmonad 1, awesome 1, bspwm 1, Hyprland 1, qtile 1 and niri 1:
total 77.

| External codebase/platform | Cells | WMs | Missing policy | Suggested revision approach, no pin performed |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| GNOME Shell/Mutter, including app-switcher schema | 38 | PaperWM | Workspace lifecycle/session wiring, activation/urgency/refocus, native move/resize, sticky/float/overlay visibility and stacking, startup stacking/tab-list policy, type/fence behavior, hotplug and output-neighbor tie order | Select a PaperWM-compatible GNOME release; record exact paired Shell/Mutter distro revisions/patches and deployed build; freeze `current-workspace-only` value/schema. |
| wlroots | 2 | sway | Adjacent-output equal-distance tie selection | Read sway `1652c54b` dependency/build declarations; pin the exact compatible deployed wlroots revision, not unrelated latest. |
| macOS proprietary host platform | 28 | paneru | WindowServer/native window policy (26), menu bar/NSStatusItem (1), native switcher (1) | No public implementation source to pin. Record macOS build, SDK and documented AX/CoreGraphics/AppKit contracts; opaque host policy still needs later observation. A new source pin cannot promise these closures. |
| Plasma session manager (ksmserver), plus app session participation | 1 | karousel | Post-session restored app set/order, rematching and layout recovery; karousel's fresh adoption is traced | Select the deployed Plasma-compatible ksmserver revision and app/session restore inputs; KWin `8438567a` is already pinned and is not this missing dependency. |
| COSMIC session manager (cosmic-session), plus app session participation | 1 | COSMIC | Session relaunch set/order and per-app restored flags; compositor recreates pinned workspace shells and freshly admits clients | Pin the deployed cosmic-session revision and session/app restore inputs; `COSMIC_SESSION_SOCK` delegates outside the pinned compositor. |
| External X session manager (identity not recorded), plus app session participation | 1 | xmonad | Post-login app relaunch set/order and restored flags; xmonad's resume-only StateFile is not cross-session app recovery | Identify and pin the deployed X session manager and session/app restore inputs; xmonad scans and freshly admits live clients, with fullscreen requiring a new ClientMessage. |
| External X session manager (identity not recorded), plus app session participation | 1 | awesome | Post-login app relaunch set/order and restored flags; atexit client order and floating X properties cover in-place re-exec, not app relaunch | Identify and pin the deployed X session manager and session/app restore inputs; awesome freshly admits clients and reads their new EWMH flags. |
| External X session manager (identity not recorded), plus app session participation | 1 | bspwm | Post-login app relaunch set/order and restored flags; dump/load retains live X window IDs and has no cross-session identity rematching | Identify and pin the deployed X session manager and session/app restore inputs; bspwm freshly admits new clients, with fullscreen depending on relaunch flags. |
| External session manager (identity not recorded), plus app session participation | 1 | Hyprland | Post-login app relaunch set/order and restored flags; config reload has no window/layout store or session identity rematching | Identify and pin the deployed session manager and session/app restore inputs; Hyprland freshly admits clients, with maximum/fullscreen requiring fresh client requests. |
| External session manager (identity not recorded), plus app session participation | 1 | qtile | Post-login app relaunch set/order and restored flags; QtileState covers in-place X11 re-exec, not cross-session app recovery | Identify and pin the deployed session manager and session/app restore inputs; qtile freshly admits clients from new flags, with no per-window layout/intent store. |
| External session manager (identity not recorded), plus app session participation | 1 | niri | Post-login app relaunch set/order and restored flags; niri-session launches the compositor and startup commands fresh-spawn, with no app/layout recovery store | Identify and pin the deployed session manager and session/app restore inputs; niri freshly admits clients, with native maximum/fullscreen requiring new client flags. |
| External session manager (identity not recorded), plus app session participation | 1 | sway | Post-login app relaunch set/order and flags; reload is config-only with no layout recovery store | Identify and pin the deployed session manager and session/app restore inputs; sway freshly admits clients, with fullscreen requiring fresh flags. |

  persistence and fresh startup scan/admission traced; session app relaunch
  remains outside the pinned WM, with secondary order/flags fixture limits).
- External X session manager/bspwm: R-RST-02 (same-session dump/re-exec,
  retained client X IDs, fresh admission and manual-only orphan adoption
  traced; session app relaunch remains outside the pin, with secondary
  per-app flags/order fixture limits).
- External session manager/Hyprland: R-RST-02 (config-only reload, fresh
  map-time admission/routing and fresh client maximum/fullscreen traced;
  session relaunch outside the pin, with secondary app flags/order limits).

- External session manager/sway: R-RST-02 (config-only reload and fresh
  admission traced; session app relaunch outside the pin, with secondary

- Secondary host limits are excluded from primary unlock counts. PaperWM's
  newly F cells R-WS-12/22, R-RST-01 and R-SPC-03/13 retain host
  qualifications; R-DRAG-04 retains host Esc-interception uncertainty.
  COSMIC's pinned `cosmic-comp` references are not external missing hosts.
  Its lockfile-pinned smithay/x11rb hint mapping is now traced; R-SPC-07 is
  F for the per-axis absent-height X11 fixture encoding, not missing source.

## Fixture-gap aggregate

**297 cells across 92 scenario rows.** This ledger identifies wording to
tighten in Given, When or the profile; it does not edit scenarios or choose
the missing values. Counts include two HYP explicit-swap extras. The existing
profile defaults remain fixed; projection entries ask how a foreign fixture
maps to that profile, not permission to change defaults.

## Ranked per-WM passes and expected yield

Rank by unfinished source-candidate count N, then N+U for ties. These are
triage candidate pools, not measured completion forecasts. N+U is the
upper candidate yield for a pass also closing unsupported statements;
3 remaining N cells have recorded secondary fixture/host/live limitations.
There are 10 N cells without those recorded secondary barriers. Further tracing
can discover additional limits, so neither number guarantees closure.

| Rank | WM | Source candidates N | Cheap U | N+U ceiling | N with F/H/L secondary |

Context-sized area splits are given in the N table. The completed PaperWM
pass used navigation/admission, window states, workspaces/output, mouse/groups,
and persistence/special-window slices; U cells were evaluated with their area.

## PaperWM source-pass outcome

- All **70 N + 8 U attempted**, with independent source verification of
  every slice after corrections. **34 N + 8 U closed (42 cells)**;
  **36 N reclassified: 21 H, 8 F, 7 L**. No N/U candidates remain.
- New H cells are listed in the host ledger. New F: R-DRAG-01/04/06,
  R-RST-01, R-SPC-03/13, R-WS-12/22. New L: R-MAX-01,
  R-MIN-01/02/03, R-SPC-05/10/11. Secondary limits remain explicit in cells.
- Existing 17 H, 6 F and 2 L cells were left unchanged. Current PaperWM
  residual is **61: H38/F14/L9**. Other profiles, scenario wording and
  approved rules were preserved; no material approved-rule contradictions.
- Evidence is pinned extension policy, not live runtime acceptance. No live
  testing, source-checkout changes or stash changes were performed.

## karousel source-pass outcome

- All **58 N + 8 U attempted**, with independent source verification of
  every slice after corrections. **29 N + 8 U closed (37 cells)**;
  **29 N reclassified: 1 H, 24 F, 4 L**. No N/U candidates remain.
- New H: R-RST-02 (unpinned Plasma session manager ksmserver and app
  participation). New F: R-COL-01; R-FLT-12; R-INS-01..07; R-LAY-06;
  R-CLOSE-02; R-MAX-06; R-MIN-01/03; R-RSZ-01; R-DRAG-05;
  R-START-01..03; R-RST-01/03; R-SPC-01/02/13. New L: R-MAX-01;
  R-SPC-05/10/11. Secondary limits remain explicit in cells.
- Existing 3 F and 4 L cells were unchanged. Current karousel residual is
  **36: H1/F27/L8**. Other profiles, scenarios and approved rules were
  preserved; no material approved-rule contradictions.
- Pinned KWin native paths were traced using raw `KDE/kwin@8438567a`
  citations, including script focus, native switching, fixed desktops,
  sticky, close/minimize, move/resize, new-window activation and window order.
  No live testing, source-checkout changes or stash changes were performed.

## paneru source-pass outcome

- All **57 N + 13 U attempted**, with independent source verification of
  every slice after corrections. **38 N + 13 U closed (51 cells)**;
  **19 N reclassified: 10 H, 6 F, 3 L**. No N/U candidates remain.

  R-COL-07/09; R-MNZ-01/02. New L: R-MIN-01/02/03.
- Existing H18/F3/L1 cells were unchanged. Current paneru residual is
  **41: H28/F9/L4**. macOS host implementation is not public; no new source
  pin can resolve its opaque policy. Secondary limits remain named in cells.
- Other profiles, scenarios and approved rules were preserved; no material
  approved-rule contradictions. No code changes, live testing, source-checkout
  changes or stash changes. The archived paneru note records corrections
  and accepted independent evidence.

## COSMIC source-pass outcome

- All **41 N + 8 U attempted**, with separate independent source verification
  of every area slice and a strict final occurrence-aware check. **21 N + 8 U
  closed (29 cells)**; **20 N reclassified: 1 H, 14 F, 5 L**. No N/U remain.
- New H: R-RST-02 (`cosmic-session`, session/app relaunch participation).
  New F: R-CLOSE-05; R-INS-04/06; R-MOV-08; R-MIN-01/03;
  R-MAX-09; R-MOU-02/03; R-OUT-06; R-WS-12/20; R-CTL-04; R-SPC-07.
  New L: R-FLT-05; R-MIN-02; R-MAX-01/05; R-START-03.
- Existing F19/L14 cells unchanged. Current COSMIC residual is **53:
  H1/F33/L19**. Lockfile-pinned smithay/x11rb mapping was traced without a
  new source revision; only X11 per-axis absent-height fixture encoding remains.
- Approved rules unchanged. Source comparisons requiring user review and
  explicit existing deviation coverage are listed with rule/source locations
  in [COSMIC's archived note](archive/cosmic-reference-source-fill.md).
  REQ-MAX-08/09 retain OPEN/unresolved wording despite earlier Windows policy
  text; this pass does not reconcile that product decision.
- No scenario/code/source-checkout/stash changes or live testing.
- Final executable reconciliation: 95 assertions passed after independent
  review and the Lead's archived-path checker repair, including
  every per-WM class partition/actual TBD count, N-area row/column totals,
  occurrence/scope/citation checks, fixture membership and exact COSMIC H/F/L
  ledger reconciliation. Three stash object identities and source pin preserved.

## xmonad source-pass outcome

- All **41 N + 23 U attempted**, with independent source verification of
  every area slice. **25 N + 23 U closed (48 cells)**; **16 N reclassified:
  1 H, 11 F, 4 L**. No N/U candidates remain.
- New H: R-RST-02 (external X session manager, plus app session participation).
  New F: R-CLOSE-02/04; R-FLT-03; R-INS-04; R-MAX-02;
  R-MOV-01/03/04/08/09 (main legs only); R-SPC-07.
  New L: R-MIN-01..03; R-MAX-05. INS-04 retains secondary live settlement;
  RST-02 retains secondary app set/order/flags fixture limits.
- Existing F7/L4 unchanged. Current xmonad residual is **27: H1/F18/L8**.
  Exact foreign move fixtures retain TBD rather than guessing a Tall
  projection. SPC-11 closes sourced exit classification without requiring
  beyond-Observe frames/focus.
- Approved rules unchanged. Source differences, explicit existing deviation
  coverage, corrections and final verification are recorded in
  [xmonad's archived note](archive/xmonad-reference-source-fill.md).
- No scenario/code/source-checkout/stash changes or live testing.

## awesome source-pass outcome

- All **50 N + 12 U attempted**, with separate independent source verification
  of every slice and a fresh audit of corrected admission, delayed focus and
  restart chains. **24 N + 12 U closed (36 cells)**; **26 N reclassified:
  1 H, 17 F, 8 L**. No N/U candidates remain.
- New H: R-RST-02 (external X session manager and app relaunch participation).
  New F: R-INS-04/06; R-MOU-03; R-OUT-01/06/07; R-RST-01;
  R-WS-01/02/05/06/12/17/21/22/23/26. New L: R-MIN-01..03;
  R-SPC-08/09/12/13; R-WS-25. Secondary limits remain explicit in cells.
- Existing F19/L8 unchanged. Current awesome residual is **53: H1/F36/L16**.
  Corrected source orientation: `client_array_push` prepends, so ordinary
  newcomers become the first/master tile, not the last stack member.
  Already-resolved/excluded cells remain outside this pass; the archived note
  records older append wording discovered there for separate correction.
- Approved rules unchanged. Source comparisons, correction evidence and final
  verification are recorded in [awesome's archived note](archive/awesome-reference-source-fill.md).
- No scenario/code/source-checkout/stash changes or live testing.

## bspwm source-pass outcome

- All **42 N + 20 U attempted**, with independent source verification of
  every slice and a separate corrected-policy/fixture/comparison audit.
  **33 N + 20 U closed (53 cells)**; **9 N reclassified: 1 H, 7 F, 1 L**.
  No N/U candidates remain.
- New H: R-RST-02 (external X session manager, per-app relaunch participation).
  New F: R-FOC-03/04; R-INS-04/06; R-MOV-13; R-SPC-07; R-WS-04.
  New L: R-MIN-02 (native shrink/grow settlement). Secondary limits remain
  explicit; session relaunch retains per-app flags/order fixture limits.
- Existing F20/L8 unchanged. Current bspwm residual is **37: H1/F27/L9**.
  Vacant-leaf insertion wraps at live destination focus; occupied geometry
  collapses the vacant child, with the saved-rectangle axis still fixture-bound.
  Dump/restore keeps live client X IDs; it is not cross-session app rematching.
- Approved rules unchanged. Eight source comparisons and correction evidence
  are recorded in [bspwm's archived note](archive/bspwm-reference-source-fill.md).
- No scenario/code/source-checkout/stash changes or live testing.

## Hyprland source-pass outcome

- All **44 N + 17 U attempted**, with separate independent source verification
  of each of five area slices and a corrected-policy/comparison audit.
  **27 N + 17 U closed (44 cells)**; **17 N reclassified: 1 H, 12 F, 4 L**.
  No N/U candidates remain.
- New H: R-RST-02 (external session manager and app relaunch participation).
  New F: R-FLT-03/06; R-INS-04/06; R-MAX-06; R-MOV-06/12;
  R-OUT-06; R-MOU-02/03; R-WS-20/23. New L: R-MAX-05;
  R-MIN-02/03; R-WS-26. Secondary limits remain explicit, including WS-26's
  remembered-origin activation and native settlement on FLT-06/MAX-06.
- Existing F41/L8 unchanged. Current Hyprland residual is **66:
  H1/F53/L12**. Lockfile-pinned hyprutils containment is traced, not a missing
  host: the MOV-12 seam selects U2. MOV-06's exact leaf remains fixture-bound.
- Overprecision resize and MOV-07 TBDs were removed only where Observe did
  not require numeric shares/steps/axes. WS-20 was reopened for E's unspecified
  numeric ID; ordinal order does not prove the numeric+1 target is E.
- Approved rules unchanged. Eight source comparisons, source corrections and
  final verification are recorded in [Hyprland's archived note](archive/hyprland-reference-source-fill.md).
- No scenario/code/source-checkout/stash changes or live testing.

## qtile source-pass outcome

- All **37 N + 21 U attempted**, with independent source verification of
  all four slices and a fresh residual/approved-rule audit. **22 N + 21 U
  closed (43 cells)**; **15 N reclassified: 1 H, 9 F, 5 L**. No N/U remain.
- New H: R-RST-02 (external session manager and per-app relaunch).
  New F: R-FLT-06/09; R-INS-06; R-MAX-01; R-MOV-06; R-OUT-06;
  R-RST-01; R-WS-12/17. New L: R-MAX-05/06; R-MIN-01..03.
  Secondary live/fixture limits remain explicit in cells.
- Existing F25/L8 unchanged. Current qtile residual is **48:
  H1/F34/L13**. Profile backend remains unspecified: fullscreen retains its
  tiled slot, maximize removes it; X11 restart freshly re-admits while
  Wayland has no restart journey. QueryTree focus is F, not missing-host H.
- Approved rules unchanged. Source comparisons, corrected policy and final
  verification are recorded in [qtile's archived note](archive/qtile-reference-source-fill.md).
- No scenario/code/source-checkout/stash changes or live testing.

## niri source-pass outcome

- All **41 N + 12 U attempted**, with independent source verification of
  all five slices and fresh verification of the corrected mouse branches.
  **32 N + 12 U closed (44 cells)**; **9 N reclassified: 1 H, 6 F, 2 L**.
  No N/U candidates remain.
- New H: R-RST-02 (external session manager and app relaunch participation).
  New F: R-DRAG-01/02/07; R-MOU-02/03; R-OUT-06.
  New L: R-MAX-01; R-MIN-02. Secondary limits remain explicit in cells.
- Existing F6/L5 unchanged. Current niri residual is **20: H1/F12/L7**.
  Pointer drops have NewColumn/InColumn/Floating branches and overview
  workspace targeting; a pause can change insertion through edge auto-scroll.
  These selectors remain fixture-bound, rather than guessed closed.
- Approved rules unchanged. Source comparisons, rejected approaches and
  corrected verification are recorded in [niri's archived note](archive/niri-reference-source-fill.md).
- No scenario/code/source-checkout/stash changes or live testing.

## sway source-pass outcome

- All **12 N + 24 U attempted**, with independent source verification of
  three slices and corrected-policy/comparison audits. **8 N + 22 U closed
  (30 cells)**; **6 reclassified: 1 H, 5 F**. No sway N/U remain.
- New H: R-RST-02. New F: R-OUT-01/06; R-MOU-03; R-WS-12/17.
  Existing H2/F16/L17 unchanged. Residual **41: H3/F21/L17**.
- Criteria-targeted whole-workspace moves reach hidden WS2; active-only
  unsupported wording was corrected. Hotplug focus includes destroy listeners;
  per-L history does not fix sway's global seat history. Empty-source relative
  send focus resolves to the workspace node without an extra fixture gap.
- Approved rules unchanged. Nine independently verified comparisons and
  rejected traces/corrections are recorded in
  [sway's archived note](archive/sway-reference-source-fill.md).
- No scenario/code/source-checkout/stash changes or live testing.

## Verification and next action

- Initial triage independent occurrence-aware recount: 1,896 reference cells, 1,006 TBD;
  no KWin column; Ours TBD 169. Classification multiset exactly matches
  all TBD occurrences, including five duplicated row/profile keys.
- Initial triage aggregates reconciled: WM/area N totals 506; H 37; F 178 across 63 rows;
  L 97; U 188. The fixture table's cell counts sum to 178.
- Initial triage independent Worker sampled 48 cells, at least three per WM, spanning all
  classes (N17/H9/F15/L4/U3). Forty-seven rationales confirmed; paneru
  MOV-03 was corrected to refer to the actual TBD explicit-swap leg rather
  than the resolved main leg. Its N class is unchanged. Three secondary
  notes were corrected: Hyprland LAY-06 client timing, sway MOU-03's
  input-less fixture qualification, awesome SPC-03's unpinned app source.
- Initial triage temporary evidence: `/tmp/opencode/reference-triage-inventory.json`,
  twelve `reference-triage-<WM>.json` files, `reference-triage-aggregate.json`
  and `reference-triage-spot-check.json`. These are session artifacts, not
  repository dependencies; the durable classification ledgers are above.
- Current aggregates: 1,896 reference cells, 549 TBD; N13/H77/F297/L140/U22.
  Area N totals sum to 13; fixture ledger sums to 297 across 92 rows.
  The PaperWM, karousel, paneru, COSMIC, xmonad, awesome, bspwm, Hyprland, qtile and niri outcomes and independent verification are recorded
  above and in their archived notes, plus sway; final occurrence-aware and diff-scope
  checks accompany each pass.
- Exact next action for PaperWM: none. Host-source pinning, fixture inputs
  and live-only observations remain user-owned; another WM pass is separate.
- Exact next action for karousel: none. Its remaining session-manager source,
  fixture inputs and live-only observations remain user-owned.
- Exact next action for paneru: none. Its remaining opaque macOS host policy,
  fixture inputs and live-only observations remain user-owned.
- Exact next action for COSMIC source fill: none; no N/U areas remain. User
  review of the listed rule differences, session-source pinning, fixture inputs
  and live-only observations remain separate follow-up work.

  independently rerun after archive. Exact changed-candidate/exclusion scope,
  all partitions and actual counts, N-area sums, fixture membership and
  xmonad H/F/L ledgers reconcile. Checkouts/pins and three stash object
  identities preserved; scenario/profile/rule/other-WM text unchanged.

  after archive and verification-plumbing repair. Exact 61-candidate scope,
  full multiline preservation, all actual per-WM counts/partitions, N-area
  sums, exact fixture memberships and Hyprland H/F/L ledgers reconcile.
  Fixture ledger totals 277 across 92 rows. Source pin/clean checkout,
  lockfile dependency narHash and three stash identities preserved; scenario,
  profile, approved-rule and other-WM text unchanged.
- Exact next action for qtile source fill: none; no N/U areas remain.
  User review of listed comparisons, external session-manager identification,

  Integrated verification covers exact candidate/exclusion scope, multiline
  preservation, all WM counts/partitions, N-area sums, fixture membership,
  sway ledgers, nine comparison rows, pinned ranges, local links, clean pins
  and three stash object identities. Only i3 N13/U22 remain for source filling.
