//! Project-driven Win+Left stationary gesture: portable classifier plus bounded queue.
//!
//! The OS delivers the gesture through a prompt `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook ([`sys`],
//! `cfg(windows)` only); this module owns the portable decision state so
//! deterministic tests cover queueing, down/up consumption, pointer
//! coalescing, invalidation, zero-movement, and owner settle vocabulary
//! without native calls.
//!
//! Contract (selected stationary mover):
//! - Win (either side) + left-button binds a managed TILED mover even when
//!   unfocused. No focused-only restriction, no extra-modifier gate.
//! - Floating/sticky members stay native titlebar-only: the hook never arms
//!   on them (the owner publishes tiled-only origins), so their Win+Left
//!   passes through untouched.
//! - The real window keeps its source allocation mid-gesture; release places
//!   through the shared Engine drop once. Zero movement, Esc, self,
//!   other-centre, outside, and invalidation make no plan and change no
//!   geometry.
