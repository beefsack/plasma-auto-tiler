//! Durable platform-neutral authoritative session/domain and lifecycle foundation.
//!
//! transport-independent authoritative lifecycle over the ordered N-ary
//! [`crate::directional`] topology and the [`crate::geometry`] projector.
//! No platform, process, IPC, or native execution imports; only directional
//! semantic types, the portable projector, and the [`crate::contract`] /
//! [`crate::reconcile`] identity and acknowledgement model.
//!
//! Transaction model (immutable/transactional):
//! - `Session` owns logical `(OutputId, WorkspaceId)` domains, tiled topology
//!   and shares, the focused leaf, exception observation state, and the accepted
//!   revision (mirroring the internal [`crate::reconcile::Reconciler`]).
//! - `propose`: `&mut Session` + command/observation -> `SessionPlan` or
//!   refusal. Refusals leave state unchanged (except terminal divergence,
//!   which clears pending like the reconciler). At most one pending plan.
//! - `acknowledge`: delegates to the reconciler acknowledgement binding;
//!   terminal divergence clears the pending desired state like
//!   `note_adapter_loss`.
//! - `verify_lifecycle`: delegates to the reconciler lifecycle verifier; on
//!   commit the pending desired topology/focus/exceptions are applied and the
//!   accepted revision advances by exactly one. Terminal divergence clears the
//!   pending desired state.
//! - Acknowledgement/verification reuse the existing reconciler state machine;
//!   no second acknowledgement state machine exists here.
//!
//! Placement policy (explicit `cosmic_v1` lifecycle policy, deterministic,
//! source-evidenced where COSMIC establishes behavior):
//! - Versioned [`crate::contract::LIFECYCLE_POLICY_VERSION`] (`cosmic_v1`);
//!   plans/dispatch carry the binding and the reconciler rejects mismatches.
//!   Frozen R1-R4 movement APIs/fixtures are unaffected.
//! - Admission axis is owned by [`crate::cosmic_v1::admission_axis`]:
//!   target geometry width strictly greater than height selects portable
//!   [`Axis::Horizontal`] (splits width, source `Orientation::Vertical`),
//!   otherwise [`Axis::Vertical`] (vertical on tie).
//!   The first tiled admitted window in an empty logical domain becomes a root
//!   leaf; automatic admission always wraps the focused eligible leaf in an
//!   ordered binary group old/new carrying the admission axis and
//!   [`crate::cosmic_v1::new_group_shares`] (source `TilingLayout::new_group`
//!   2898-2936 via `map_to_tree` 548-617). Same-axis N-ary parent append never
//!   applies to admission; N-ary groups remain for movement/drag only. The new
//!   leaf is focused (deterministic project fallback; COSMIC does not
//!   establish admission focus).
//! - Input placement orientation is carried explicitly as logical `bounds`
//!   (target geometry for the split, output geometry for the no-focus root
//!   case under the same rule).
//! - When no eligible focus exists in the target domain but a tree exists,
//!   the entire root is wrapped old/new under the same admission axis/shares;
//!   focus fallback only, not source COSMIC parity.
//! - Removal retains empty logical domains (trees become
//!   `None`), removes empty groups, and collapses single-child groups
//!   recursively (survivor promotion mirrors `unmap_internal` structurally).
//!   Shares use [`crate::cosmic_v1::proportional_removal_shares`] before
//!   collapse (portable N-ary adaptation of `remove_window` 255-283).
//!   Unaffected subtree identity/order and shares are preserved
//!   (a collapsed child inherits its collapsed parent slot). A focused removal
//!   falls back through the source domain's MRU tiled focus stack; an unfocused
//!   removal preserves focus. Floating/fullscreen fallback is not represented
//!   by this tiled-only focus type.
//! - Floating/fullscreen/maximized/sticky exception flags are explicit. An
//!   admission carrying any set flag without an explicit
//!   [`ExceptionBehavior`] fails closed instead of silently tiling. An
//!   admission carrying `Some` behavior with no set flag is malformed and
//!   refused.
//!
//! Domain model: logical outputs and workspaces are separate domains keyed by
//! the distinct `(OutputId, WorkspaceId)` pair with exact opaque ids preserved
//! and deterministic construction order. Trees, focus, and projected geometry
//! are domain-scoped. The portable [`SessionSnapshot`] carries ordered N-ary
//! trees and [`WindowLink`]s and may repeat an `OutputId` across workspaces;
//! the frozen [`crate::directional::Snapshot`] cannot represent duplicate
//! output ids and is therefore exposed only per single logical domain via
//! [`Session::domain_snapshot`], never as a global abused snapshot.
//!
//! Plans carry full portable identity binding (owner/generation/correlation/
//! base revision via [`crate::contract::LifecycleDispatch`]), the semantic
//! lifecycle intent, affected ids (operation plus desired snapshot), required
//! capabilities/preconditions, desired topology/focus, and complete desired
//! geometry for affected tiled windows. No native commands exist here.
