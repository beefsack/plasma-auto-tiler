# Tentative 0.1 offline-preparation recipe. Not yet built on OBS; see
# docs/installation.md for status, blockers, and the KWin-upgrade policy.
# Package names below were verified against the live openSUSE Tumbleweed,
# Fedora 43, and Fedora 44 repositories in October 2026 except where noted.
#
# Source contract: Source0 is the immutable GitHub Release tarball produced
# by release.yml (scripts/build-source-archive.sh). It already contains the
# prebuilt KWin bundle (kwin/contents/code/main.js) and the vendored Rust
# crates (vendor/), so this recipe never runs npm and never touches the
# network: the KWin script is installed as files, and Cargo builds fully
# offline. A raw git checkout (tar_scm) would lack both and must not be
# substituted here.

%description
Core of OmniTiler: the KWin script (prebuilt, no Node needed at
packaging time), the Rust planner/tray binary with on-demand D-Bus plus
systemd user activation, the application icon, and both native settings
pages (the effect settings page and the native script settings page, the
Configure page referenced by the KWin script). The settings pages are
KWin-independent (Qt/KF6 only); the effect reconfigure tolerates an absent
effect.

Tiling and Settings work with this package alone. Only the active-border
effect itself needs the companion omnitiler-native-effect package
(ABI-matched to your KWin).

Revert before removing: open Settings and press Revert (Revert Shortcuts,
plus Revert to KDE default on any changed host row) to restore host keys
and shortcut overrides. Removal does not restore them; Settings lives in
this package, so press Revert before removing it. If you already removed
without reverting, reinstall this package and press Revert. Disabling the
script is separate (set omnitiler-kwinEnabled=false and reconfigure
KWin).

%package native-effect
Summary:        OmniTiler native KWin effect (active border)
Requires:       %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
# Deliberately unversioned: this package must never hold a KWin upgrade
# back (a pinned Requires would block host security updates), and an exact
# Requires would still not prove the loaded .so matches the running KWin.
# Rebuilds track KWin via the cmake(KWin) BuildRequires above; see
# docs/installation.md for the upgrade-window limitation and the
# versioned factory IID and same-version ABI-patch limitation.

%description native-effect
Optional ABI-bound companion: the native active-border effect only. The
settings pages (with Revert) live in the core package, so removing this
companion alone leaves Settings and Revert available. Tied to the KWin
development headers it was built against; after a KWin upgrade, update this
package before relying on the effect. Removing it leaves core tiling and
Settings working, minus the border effect.
The exact-version core requirement keeps effect/core installs paired. This
split layout (both KCM plugins in core, effect plugin here) is new and
pre-release: no predecessor was ever published, so no file-ownership
migration across updates is claimed.

Revert before removing: no Revert step is lost by removing this package
alone (Settings stays in core). Removal does not restore host keys or
shortcut overrides; press Revert in the core Settings before removing core.
If you already removed core without reverting, reinstall core and press
Revert.
Disabling the script or unloading the effect is separate.
