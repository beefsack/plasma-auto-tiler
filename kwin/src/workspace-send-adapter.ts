// Bounded COSMIC send-to-workspace adapter (standalone, dev-only, disabled by
// default).
//
// Product-shaped but with no normal startup route: ordinary production startup
// never runs this module (src/entry.ts must not import it and no controller
// route may import it; the module constraints below are the explicit wiring
// contract). The only activation is the explicit exported
// WorkspaceSendAdapter class plus the separate entry helper, called by no
// production source.
//
// This adapter carries the existing portable COSMIC same-output
// distinct-workspace send operation over the ONE existing DescribePlan D-Bus
// transport. Rust owns all planning, topology, membership, focus, and rejection
// policy and commits the planned topology synchronously in the same call,
// returning both-domain geometry plus the native assignment. This module owns
// KWin observation of the focused output's source and target desktops, owner
// activation/pinning, a single request round trip, exact source+target
// re-validation, synchronous planned-geometry writes then the mover's
// Window.desktops membership write, and exactly one follow (target desktop
// switch then mover focus, no retry) on a fresh exact native membership proof:
// mover absent from source and present on target. The proof comes from an
// immediate post-write observation AND a one-shot mover desktopsChanged signal
// for delayed arrival. There is no ack/verify/cancel/abandon/status protocol,
// no per-window geometry echo, no settlement timer, and no blocksPlan: Plan is
// never blocked by a send flight.
//
// Source and target stay pinned from dispatch until arrival or a bounded
// arrival deadline; a separate unanswered-request deadline releases the flight
// and late replies are ignored by token. Every terminal path (arrival, failed
// native write, stale reply, rejected/diverged reply, missing callback,
// timeout, closed mover, disable with a live flight) clears the pin and calls
// exactly one entry-owned `onSettled` hook for a forced complete source AND
// target refresh through the single-flight Plan chain. Pre-flight refusals
// carry no hook and leave no flight.
//
// Activation first uses NameHasOwner's normal boolean reply. A present owner is
// resolved and pinned; only a confirmed absent name runs one
// StartServiceByName(service, 0) phase accepting 1 PrimaryOwner / 2
// AlreadyOwner, followed by one post-start GetNameOwner. Every planner call
// targets that pinned unique `:N.M` owner. Two one-shot timers, no retry, no
// polling. Same-UID authorization stays solely the Planner's existing single
// check.
//
// Refusal routes are exact bounded tokens: no-planner, owner-loss,
// stale-revision, cross-output, same-output, same-workspace, target-mismatch,
// transfer-unavailable, absent-focus, non-tiled-focus, desktop-cap (observed
// desktop count above the KWin cap of 25), and last-desktop (no distinct
// target desktop can exist). `cross-output` guards the same-output route;
// `same-output` guards the explicit output-send route (use workspace send);
// `target-mismatch` is a drifted output-send destination; `transfer-unavailable`
// is missing output-transfer capabilities. Pre-flight refusals
// (scope-invalid plus the requestSend validation tokens above) log one
// structured best-effort `plasma-auto-tiler:route-diag` line and return false
// with the adapter still enabled, so a later valid send can proceed.
//
// All logs carry fixed fields (component, stage, correlation, generation,
// revision, event, outcome) with no sensitive, native, or payload data.
